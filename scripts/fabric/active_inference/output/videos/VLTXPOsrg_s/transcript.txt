hello welcome everyone it's January 29th 2025 we're in active inference guest stream 97.1 with Dr Matthew Sims discussing a cellular slime mold a jumping off point for exploring different Notions of biological memory so thank you for joining looking forward to hearing more thanks so much hello welcome everyone it's January 2 2025 we're in returning in 1 second thank you we're back back like a slime mold returning we're back should I start or should I should we just go for it yeah yeah begin begin from the beginning of the presentation thank you I I can't hear you oh thank you we're back go for it okay sorry about that um so yeah uh today I'm going to be looking at a couple of questions regarding uh feran polyam which is a cellular slime mold and I'm going to be looking at uh different Notions of memory that have been thought about in the biological sciences not necessarily in for example when you're thinking about large language models or when you're thinking about computational memory outside of biological systems but uh biological memory and pheran polyam is a kind of is a springboard if you will for thinking about things like this now this uh organism I'm going to get a little bit into its biology uh and a little bit into kind of it's It's its complex life cycles and these are these are different things that I I kind of uh have researched and uh thought about in in in the kind of more recent book that I've uh published with Cambridge University press called slim molden philosophy uh and this particular talk that you'll see right now is going to be uh kind of an excerpt if you will from a couple of the chapters namely chapter three of the book uh and looking at memory I think it's a quite nice uh way to get to get to get a kind of an overall understanding of the importance of this this system this model system and it's a system that's becoming used more and more to investigate various questions uh in either cognitive science or in ecology or in or in philosophy biology or theoretical biology more generally uh questions like uh biological individuality for example questions like uh you know uh the the the biological or the biological status of of something like a Spore dormant Spore uh when we're thinking about living systems being systems that are more generally systems that are metabolically active so what does that mean if life is you have a form of life that's not metabolically active and looking at the biology of something like uh pheran polylon or slime mold can really I I think it's very kind of instrumental into digging into these questions more theoretical questions and also you can explore and expand upon these questions by generating hypothesis that can be really tested in a organism that's quite easy to culture uh so this talk uh is going to proceed as follows with that kind of background um I'm going to look at what ferum is then I'm going to turn to a really really really beautiful experiment it's a very interesting and Powerful experiment experiment welld designed by Chris Reed uh and colleagues uh at MC University uh they're still they're still doing experiments with ferum uh and this particular experiment is is about kind of externalized memory in phum uh I'll look at that experiment go through it then I'll look at different forms of biological memory uh and these different forms of biological memory I'm going to cap it out at three or four different forms of biological memory and try to connect them um and then I'm going to ask a question regarding uh whether or not one of one or more of these forms of biological memory requires uh an explanation uh using kind of cognitive theories or cognitive Frameworks uh and I'm going to answer that question uh using the notion of metabolic individuality it's a again it's biological individuality which we'll get into during the talk also and so applying this particular type of Criterion from biological individuality or metabolic individuality as a Criterion I'm going to be able to kind of rule out which levels uh of memory depending upon the levels of biological organization that these this memory happens in uh are you know the the warranted targets of cognitive explanation so uh what's pheran polyon so pher polyam uh uh it's it's the the Latin name the the genus is for zeram um and polyam is the kind of the species the species name the species addon and that generally means uh you know many headed and they say this many-headed in the sense that it's a many uh the Spore comes out of a what looks like to be a many headed uh Fring body uh generally it's an it's an acellular slime mold uh it's a protest a unicellular protest and it has a very interesting complex life cycle and when I say complex life cycle what I mean is that uh it has it's m has multi faets it's multifaceted in a sense that um it has more than one vegetative stage one the one than more stage where it actually has a form that reproduces and and kind of uh you know forges eats uh and this stage goes from a Spore uh at number one the Spore actually germinates and out from the Spore you have something called a a bif flatulate cell or a mix amiba cell now uh a mix amoeba comes out of the Spore it germinates from the Spore When there's less water in the environment the bif flatulate actually is something that is the kind of the fella are going to be something that's synthesized when there's more water in the area when it uh germinates now uh during a mix amoeba stage it can reproduce asexually uh so there are many many different kind of clones clone cells and each of these have a single nucleus uh one it actually encounters another type another mix amoeba of the same uh the same type not necessarily genetically the same uh they can actually come together and this when you have that's when you have a type of reproduction that occurs it's uh uh mosis without actually uh cell separation so without cyto Kinesis and that's when you start having this particular growth of a cell and these are all these are all microscopic small single cells uh until this stage where the nucle reproduce and it starts growing and becomes uh visible to the eye and this is becomes a plasmo stage this plasmodial stage is the stage at which uh most of the experiments with ferum occur uh and uh it's it's it's very interesting stage because this at this stage uh the ferum the cell again it's a single cell multinuclear single cell uh crawls over and locomotes over various surfaces you can design experiments watching this particular type of locomotion now again I talked about the veget ative stage uh I've said pretty much this during this vegetative stage um pum uh during this plasmodial stage it's going to consume bacteria fungi and decaying organic matter and again here you have a a a picture from one of my lab experiments of AUM just uh locomoting and covering oats uh during this plasmodial stage or the vegetative stage one of its vegetative stages uh there's again many experiments that have shown interesting types of capacities that it displays it's been uh shown to kind of solve the shortest path problem uh engage in habituation which is a type of learning very simple type of learning anticipate periodic environmental conditions hot bursts of Air dve Bursts of air excuse me and uh make flexible behavioral decisions that are based upon compar to valuation rules rather than absolute valuation um and this is just um you know a very very brief summary of the various experiments that have been uh that ferum has been used with to engage in questions regarding things like learning things like decision- making and there many more experiments but you get a a kind of representation of what this might be now let's move on with that kind of brief understanding of what uh you know the life cycle of his Aram is and focusing upon this particular type of uh vegetative stage the plasmodial stage we can start thinking about one experiment in particular the experiment by Chris Reed and his lab over at mccre in 2012 now uh you'll see a particular you know picture here of Hansel and grle and I hope to make this clear why I'm showing this to you um so when pher when it when it locomotes over surfaces it leaves an extracellular SL slime trace or slime Trail I refer to this as es now es is um it's a poly polymus saccharide and it's a this this this mucus uh makes it easier for for zerum to actually locomote but it serves many many functions and uh it's been well known in the literature since the 50s that wherever ferum uh you know wherever it navigates wherever it locomotes it leaves this trail behind it so one question that has risen uh and a question that is kind of uh the Crocs of the experiment for rad Al is whether or not pum uses this extracellular SL to navigate so the reason why I they can ask this question has been observed that feram avoid their own extracellular slime Trails uh and the extracellular Slime Trails of others now if it's used as a type of externalized spatial memory uh avoiding you know expending energy unnecessarily to revisit patches of food again food is being uh bacteria food being fungus uh other types of microorganisms uh if you can use that to avoid previously forged patches uh then this is this becomes an interesting type of relationship with a particular type of poly mucus mucopolysaccharide right and so to test this uh they have a couple conditions two conditions so they have an AAR plate uh and this agar plate is the conditions are exactly the same except for except for one one plate of agar is covered with extracellular slime the other isn't the covered uh plate is called the the coda condition and the blank the other is the blank condition they set a u shaped acetate trap on this particular plate uh and the whole idea is to put ferum as you see in a start Zone and put a goal which is going to be a drop of highly concentrated glucose and that go is food so if uh feram is going to actually use extracellular slime to navigate and to avoid you know navigating in areas on the on the AAR that it's already navigated on uh the hypothesis is that in the coded Condition it's going to take a lot longer and that's exactly what they found it took about 10 times uh the the the time actually 10 it was 10 times greater uh in the in the coded condition in the non-quota condition so they come back to this idea and here you have kind of the Hans grle element uh as uh Reed Al kind of make the following conclusion I said the results of this study I provide a unique demonstration of spatial memory systems and non-al organisms supporting the theory that an externalized spatial memory may be the functional precursor of an internal memory of higher organisms I think this is quite interesting the two hypothesis obviously and I think one can safely ignore one of the hypothesis and concentrate on the the the kind of formal hypothesis about an externalized spatial memory system uh whether or not that system uh was a precursor to uh internal lives memory that's something else now in this particular type of uh conclusion based upon this experiment memory processes have been and and this externalized memory process has been you know interpreted as a particular type of cognitive process albeit one that extends into the environment now is that strange May yeah sure one up it it is strange but really I think there's a lot of at least for the last 20 to 30 years there's been a lot of uh uh you know a lot of research done and focused upon the idea of what's called you know the the hypothesis of extended mind the hypoth hypothesis of extended cognition and uh you know my my PhD supervisor Andy Clark he was very instrumental him and Dave Charmers were very instrumental in kind of putting that out there I think that sometimes uh you know uh cognition can be scaffolded by external elements and I think this is that that's fine I think uh if we take that if we take that assumption on board it shouldn't really matter whether or not it's on the outside or on the inside but we'll come back to this um so now I want to think about in order to actually really move on to the question is this really memory though uh which is a more fundamental question uh to think about what memory is so I'm taking a definition or characterization as I like to call it a rough characterization from uh Fran and Mike lean and uh Mike and look at memory as the follows in one of the papers so they they say it's experience dependent modification of internal structure in a stimulus specific manner that alters the way the system is going to respond to a stimulus in the future as a function of its past now I think a couple things stand out in this particular type of characterization uh one is that it's stimul is specific so breaking a bone for example is not going to count as a m there many ways to break a bone and it doesn't then the breaking a bone is not going to necessarily be dependent upon uh one type of stimulus so that's a very important element of this of this definition uh another important element which I'm pushing back on is the idea that it has to be a modification of internal structure again if we take the hypothesis of extended cognition seriously uh there's no really there there's no reason to be dependent upon this assumption about internal structure sometimes it extends and that's an assumption that I'm I'm willing to take on maybe some people won't but that's something I definitely I'm definitely willing to take on depending upon the functional kind of uh the functional analysis of what's going on here now putting this into place uh you have a different type of characterization so I think uh you can add external structure here internal structure or external structure now one important thing also about uh Lev's B Lev's characterization when they bring this up they have a footnote which says you know memory uh is going to be outstripped in terms of uh that memory that's necessarily associated with cognition necessarily associated with intelligence so there's going to be many more types of memory than those that are necessarily associated with intelligence or cognition what does that mean that's what we're going to get into next I suppose uh so you have different forms of biological memory that the ones that I'm going to look over right now for this presentation is uh these are going to be dependent upon different levels of biological organization different time scales and biological levels of organization now one is going to be cellular memory which are individual individual cells somatic cells for example uh immunological memory networks of cells and molecules so you're getting larger larger time scale uh individual organisms and then Collective uh Collective memory or on a collective scale a group of organisms necessarily I'm going to look at the notion of kind of colonal memory a colonial memory um so what's cellular memory uh in a nutshell which I'm sure many of you know uh cellular memory is going to describe how various PL poent cells uh you know stem cells differentiate into different types of cells uh and stem cells themselves after they start actually differentiating those cells reproduce uh and as they reproduce they don't go back to stem cells and then turn back into for example a fat cell the fat cells produce fat cells so there's some type of way that cells maintain the cellular type over mitosis or cellular division and this is what uh cellular memory can be understood as uh one of the ways that this occurs uh one of the mechanisms underlying this again I hope this is not too um simplify for everyone but uh I I think it's kind of an important thing to talk about anyway um is through epigenetic modification and this is one of the ways that kind of epigenetic uh markers uh and epigenetic mechanisms uh were was introduced biologically was looking through or trying to understand the question as to how differentiated cells remain differentiated over time during development during onogen ontogenesis um and these epigenetic mechanisms there many of them uh but a couple of the ones that I have here just kind of examples a histone modification where you have uh you know you have an octomer uh of histones that are going to be wrapped uh by uh a particular type of kind of strand of DNA his stones are going to make up uh these These histones are going to make up uh the chromatin and uh and going to make up they're going to make up the um the larger the larger groupings of cells sorry sorry the larger groupings of kind of DNA um and when hstone is actually wrapped very tightly when the DNA is wrapped very tightly around hisone it's it can be accessed for the uh for transcription so what that means uh you have some the brakes are put on to transcriptions or the brakes are put on uh in terms of uh uh genetic processing which is okay so that acts in and of itself as a type of memory and if one is very interested in this one can look into the work of kind of yeah you say you Blanca and Avia Blanca and Maran lamb they've done incredible research on this uh philosophically and biologically H but this is one of the things that kind of in a nutshell explains uh the way that a cell actually when it differentiates Remains the Same type of cell as the same type of cell now you have hisy modification chromatin marking uh RNA in interference there are many different types of uh you epigenetic mechanisms that can be used but this is just an overview very quick and inaccurate over you probably uh moving on to the immune system memory now uh I think uh immunis Castro says it best so I'm going to read this out for you our immune system is composed of a huge number of cells presenting receptors on their surfaces transmembrane receptors these receptors are responsible for bonding with portions of pathogens known as antigens and signaling other immune cells to eliminate the marked or recognized pathogens now uh this the invading pathogens replicate themselves inside our bodies thus increasing the amount of damage being caused to our organism one way the immune system evolved to fight against infection was by replicating our immune cell so as to cope with the replicating pathogen but the replication of immune cells is not perfect you have errors you have mutations now errors occur with a rate proportional to the quality of recognition between immune receptors uh and the pathogen recognized those mutated cells with high Affinity with the pathogen High Affinity means that uh they have in terms of their kind of uh their shape they fit together well uh they're selected maintain a repertoire called memory uh so to to just illustrate this very quickly uh you have certain cells with transmembrane receptor which are kind of represented by these different shapes coming off these circles these cells and they're going to fit better they're going to have kind of um better recognition with some of the foreign antigens the ones with that are better recognized and again uh they're going to they're going to be the ones that are put into a particular type of reservoir and they mutate and the mutation ends up actually making uh trans membrane cell cell receptors or cell transmembrane receptors that are going to actually fit even better with the pathogens and they're put in the kind of kind of again this repertoire of of memory cell memory or immunological memory organismal memory is the thing that everyone uh typically thinks about particularly from the perspective of psychology comparative psychology cognitive science uh or even modeling so um and this is just answering the question is how an organism adapts to uh via changing experiences adapts to a changing world over the lifetime uh and again it's over the lifetime that has to be uh you know put forward uh the idea that something like organismal memory occurs typically uh it's going to occur typically over uh ontogenesis over over a long trajectory of development from from birth to death um so uh the particular type of uh parag Matic way of looking at memory and looking at learning also I suppose uh people start looking at this or scientists start looking at it metazoa uh just because cognitive science which is a very still young young science uh in piggybacking off of psychology has started with humans and then thinking about other types of uh Clos closely related animals uh but now things are obviously changing a little bit people are asking questions as Chris Reed has asked questions about memory and ferum uh but this is just a little bit of the background and I'm not going to say too much about organismal memory because I think this comes uh quite intuitively given the particular type type of uh you know our approach to memory and cognitive science already um memory one thing that should be said also is that typically it's going to be associated with uh learning so uh learning is the way that uh memories are encoded uh typically but this is something that we can come back to later which I think is interesting uh particularly with vum but with other organisms such as acia now Collective memory the last type of memory I'm going to talk about um this refers to how H history dependent self-organizing behavior of a group of organisms become stabilized at the level of the collective rather than at the level of the individual that makes up that Collective and a lot of the research that has been done on Collective memory uh is the work on colonal memory uh ant colonies for example or termite colonies or um these typ these types of insects that have uh you know use use fairmon uh as a as a as a manner of uh navigating a particular type of in a spatial environment now uh Deborah Gordon she's is um a fantastic zoologist um and she was at Oxford for a while and a lot of Deb Gordon's work was with ants looking at ants and she's done some uh pretty incredible research um kind of looking at ant collectives and this is something that she writes Redwood ant a colony of Redwood ants remembers its trail system leading to the same trees year after year although no single ant does in the forest of Europe they forg high in trees and feed on excretions of aphids another type of insect small insect that in turn feeds on the tree now their nests are enormous mounds of pine needles situated in the same place for decades occupied by many generations of colonies these colonies I can just interject here some of these colonies last a very long time they're very long lifespans The Colony it does and the colony outlasts the the individual ant so e an e each ant tends to take the same Trail every day uh uh day after day to the same tree during the long Winters the ants huddled together under the snow and the Finnish neologist Raina Rosen showed that when an emerge in the spring an older ant goes out with a younger ant uh along that older ant's habitual Trail the older ant dies and then the younger ant adopts that trail as its own leading the group leading the colony to remember or reproduce the previous year's Trails so you have this particular type of connection between nodes if you will uh connecting the memories from one generation to the next year after year all the entire Colony so it's a a kind of dionic uh a dionic connection if you will so after going through all of those Notions of memory I hope that's clear that there different types of memory that are occurring at different uh temporal and spatial scales and those temporal spatial scales can be kind of demarcated by different levels of biological organization now we can ask the question uh which one of these or which which of these should I say are going to be you know subject to cognitive explanation as a cognitive process now when I say subject to cognitive explanation uh I want to make this clear uh I'm asking the question which of these particular types of memory systems or uh exhibitions of memory that we should be able to use cognitive theories and cognitive Frameworks to try to explore and understand now this is not just for example using a cognitive theory uh with scare Cotes is not an as if explanation it's not using the intentional stance uh but it's actually using cognitive theories to think about these uh and identify me these mechanisms and functional the functional placement of these particular types of memory systems as cognitive processes um so right away I think it's quite obvious that we do this with organisms that's that's going to be the paradigmatic level of biological organization at which we ask these questions which we apply our which apply our cognitive theories to our cognitive Frameworks to in a non-instrumental way but what about cellular memory what about immune system memory what about Collective memory um again we do this how are we going to get uh and the question that I ask now is how are we going to get uh any type of uh how are we going to explore this question uh because I think it's a it's a it's an interesting question we can make some assumptions and and just say that there the perhaps there's a you know similar principles running through all of them uh given this particular definition of or uh you know characterization of memory from FTI Booka and Mike L uh they all count as memory so why not apply cognitive theories to them I think there's some that can lead us into some difficult territory uh and if we do this non-selectively and so I want to look at now and introduce a particular type of way of thinking about this that's going we can kind of ring a particular type of Criterion a rough Criterion out for thinking about uh which which of these biological organizational levels really are warranted for this now warranted uh to explain in terms of uh cognitive explanations or warranted targets for our cognitive explanations one clue here is is going to come from this particular kind of uh you know passage from Pamela lion uh and she writes uh using actually I should I should I should say something about this uh this particular kind of definition that she offers or again a character ation that can be changed uh she's offering something that is very much influenced by Sarah shuttleworth who's a cognitive ecologist or cogn or cognitive ethologist excuse me uh and this particular definition is or characterization is quite I think it's again it's General but it's General enough to do some work um specific enough to do some work so cognition here comprises the sensory and other information processing mechanism an organism has for becoming familiar with valuing and interacting productively with features of its environment exploring exploiting evading in order to meet its existential needs now these are going to be the most basic of which are are survival persistence growth thriving and reproduction now if we concentrate on that the existential needs and saying this is fundamental to cognition uh we'll have various you know we'll have various philosophers various biologists various cognitive scientists who will back this up U Matana and verella are kind of the obvious ones people coming from the kind of autopoetic Frameworks a poetic Theory people coming from the organizational uh biology theories for example uh people coming from like like honas for uh uh who thinks that you know metabolism is the basis of meaningful Behavior any type of self-concern so any entity that has its own metabolic machinery is therefore uh this is going to be Central to that entities having capacities that are going to be subject to cognitive explanation another person philosopher that's out there also who who really emphasizes kind of metabolism and how it kind of Shades into cognition is someone like Peter gy Smith so uh one way to think about metabolism is through the lens of what's called a metabolic individual um and this is under the kind of under the larger or more General type of uh kind of biological philosophical philosophical framework I suppose biology thinking about what biological individuals are uh and this is a question that's come up for many many many years and one of the kind of I think fundamental uh books about this was written by Julian Huxley Thomas H Thomas Huxley uh his his grandson uh and produced in released in 1912 um and it's quite interesting uh you know Charles Darwin wrote a bit also about the biological individual uh but it wasn't until I think Julian huxley's book that a lot of and he wrote this when he was quite young I think he was 27 uh many interesting questions came out he had a very interesting a keen a sharp perspective on what the notion of biological individuality is now what is it it means when we're asking a question about what a biological individual is uh we want to provide an account uh of what in the biological World constitutes accountable and relatively well delineated cohesive unit so there two ways to go about there's two general ways to go about this there's more than two ways but I'll just concentrate on two ways here uh you can think about darwinian individuals which are going to be units of reproduction these are going to be any type of units that are capable of uh undergoing darwinian uh natural selection uh which means they have to have you know meet three criteria those three criteria that you know lant was uh you know expressed as you know variation uh or her heritable variation and selection so uh it has to meet these criteria so you have things like genes that could be a darwinian individual or chromosomes that could be a darwinian individual because these are or memes ideas these are things that can undergo darwinian natural selection these are units however there's another type of uh biological individual that you typically find in when theorizing about uh you know various biological processes various biological phenomena and this is going to be the metabolic IND idual it's going to be a unit of function that has it and this unit is going to has it have its own metabolic Machinery um so let's look now just a little bit more at metabolic individuality I think you can understand how this comes apart from darwinian individuals and I'll try to make this more explicit so uh according to Peter God Smith uh metabolic individuals are systems comprised of diverse parts which work together to maintain the system structure uh despite the turnover of material by making use of sources of energy and other resources from their environment now diverse parts that should stand out they're going to have some type of cohesion that maintain the structure of a system uh they're going to be essentially persists for things that actually serve their own self-maintenance over time things that use energy to resist the forces of Decay or a force entropy only contingently things that reproduce so that metabolic individual does not have to be a darwinian individual that's quite important so you have certain types of darwinian individuals again a gene a gene is not a metabolic individual a gene does not have its own kind of metabolic Machinery a gene is not a persister it doesn't engage in the types of uh behaviors or activities that keep keeps itself going um and metabolic individuality is a quite important concept when it comes to thinking about transitions in individuality this notion is something for many of you probably know about this but it's a notion what it comes from theoretical biology it's based upon uh Loosely based upon veers from uh the major transitions in evolution uh that was kind of formalized by uh John Mayer Smith and er Z maray and these the idea about major transitions in individuality we're thinking about how one level of biological organization reaches the next level of biological organization over evolutionary time scales and an example of this might be for example uh an example for this would be going from a proc cariot uh to a eukaryotic cell the evolution of from a Brar to eukaryotic cell or the evolution from a eukaryotic cell a single celled ukar to a multi-celled ukar um and those those particular types of transitions are quite important and a lot of kind of biological theories are you know are focused upon understanding how those transitions uh occurred over time what were the circumstances under which they occur did they occur once did they occur multiple times and many different ways um so matter look at individuality is interesting when thinking about uh you know ukar Genesis which is H how do you go from a you know single a single cell procaryotic organism uh to a eukaryotic organism with uh you know uh with a nucleus with uh various kind of uh you know Cellular Parts like a chloroplast or mitochondria uh and the idea here is that there's some type of metabolic integration most of the theories that are thinking about kind of ukog Genesis think about this in terms of a metabolic integration where two cells whether it's going to be a bacteria an alpha bacteria and some type of Aran are going to come together in some way it's going to either be by you know there different V various theories one doesn't have to be committed to the theory but looking at this particular type of illustration you have some type of fosis that's occurring from a larger cell to the smaller cell uh when that happens uh there's a depending upon the natures of those two different types of cells the the the the inner Alpha bacteria or the and the kind of the the outer uh what it's a going to be an ARCA depending upon that kind of relationship they could enter into some type of symbiotic relationship such that the output of that uh endos symbient if you will is something that's metabolically useful for its external environment which is another cell and vice versa and so this nestedness of one metabolic individual in another after time uh is going to you know evolve into a single individual where those two individuals that those two entities that were at one point in time separate are now so close knit metabolically that they're one type of individual so you have this idea that metabolic individuals can be nested uh and that's that's a quite quite important idea here metabolic individuality is going to come in degrees also for this reason so how might the notion of metabolic individuality hint at what cognitive explanations uh of memory might get the most purchase I want to argue the following uh if metabolic individuals are first and foremost persists and such self-maintenance is to be the fundamental background against which all cognitive capacities might be thought to arise again this is an assumption then the kind of memory learning decision- making anticipation for that matter that warrants possible cognitive explanation qua cognitive process is going to be the one that arises at the level of the metabolic individual now this automatically rules out genes when we talk about Gene learning or say Gene Gene regulatory systems that are going to actually you know be engaged in something like U you know associative learning or conditioning uh which there's some research that shows this I think we can say sure genes do learn but if that's the case if Gene regulatory networks are not metabolic individuals themselves I think this is a kind of a a misclassification if you will uh and because Gene regulatory Networks work within a metabolic individual they're not the metabolic individual itself uh viruses for example uh viruses are dependent upon their host for the metabolism so these things are not going to these types of entities are not going to be metabolic individuals uh and I think we kind of have a have a basis for thinking about this given the assumption that you know uh metabolic individuals are persists and that cognition first and foremost is going to function directly for the entity in which that those particular kind of capacities are working for it's going to function directly for the self-maintenance of that individual so since metabolic individuality comes in degrees uh an interesting kind of question arises so how much metabolic individuality is going to be required to Warrant memory being subject to cognitive explanation how much is too little now again if you remember the idea that I just said recently the the idea I just brought up that you can have cells within cells uh you have a mitochondrium which actually has its own has remnant of its own DNA right now within uh any type of somatic cell uh and sematic cells within organs and organs within you know organisms how do we actually think about degrees of metabolic individuality in this sense that's non-arbitrary um so I want to argue that even if some entity qualifies as a marginal metabolic individual the fact that it's part of a larger system which even has a higher rank of metabolic individuality suggests that the behavior of the organization level that's the highest degree of relative metabolic individuality is going to be subject to the explanation of cognitive memory or learning or decision making so the highest degree of metabolic individuality in a nest group and nested system is going to require actual applications of kind of cognitive theories and cognitive Frameworks in a way that's not instrumental or just taking the you know the U intentional stance so we can return to each of these forms of memory and and think about applying this particular type of question applying this particular type of criteria so we already talked about or organismal memory and I think if this is the case then we can we can take that off sure organisms are going to have the highest relative degree of metabolic individuality uh of their organizational levels of all of the levels that they actually are composed of and this is going to you know be good news to the notion of uh asking whether or not say pham's externalized memory counts as actual memory uh that should we should be apping we can be asking uh you know whether or not that type of memory if it's navigational memory uh whether it satisfies various uh types of conditions that you know people thinking about navigational memory would need to apply to it to understand its function to understand uh the mechanisms behind it better what about cellular memory uh I want to argue that cells they have their own metabolic Machinery I think that's quite obvious and they're thus they're metabolic individuals you know they metabolize and they have means to metabolize but relative to the metabolic individuality of the encompassing biological levels at which you find sematic cells uh they're quite low uh their survival is dependent obviously upon their EnV environment but the metabolic individuality and this is where you get kind the the kind of marginal metabolic individuality of kind of subotic cells uh their maintenance is something that is directed towards the maintenance of the system of which they're a part so when you get when you when you have you know somatic cells or group symatic cells uh whose maintenance is reshift towards their own existence you start having certain things like tumors uh and this is like uh you know metastasis things of that nature and I think this is this is kind of turning against this is you have a kind of turning against uh this the system of which they're apart they start using that system uh and metabolizing that system uh they become decoupled from that system another way to think about this is in terms of autonomy when a cell has too much autonomy when it regains its autonomy from the system of which it's a part A sematic Cell uh that cell actually becomes delarius for the system so it's not controlled by the system anymore so I would like to say that something like you know cellular memory uh we can use the intentional stance to talk about it maybe that'll get us somewhere but I think to use something non-instrumentally uh is it's actually a conflation given uh given what again given what uh the the different typ types of Transitions and individuality that have occurred over evolutionary time scales have led to the dependencies upon these different types of organizational levels and differences in autonomy uh so no I don't believe that's the case uh that cellular memory should be targeted with cognitive theories in any non-instrumental way immune system memory I think is the same thing really the cells of an immune system they have their own metabolic machinery and a certain degree of metabolic auton sure um long-term functioning of metabolic processes and Persistence of the network of immune specific cells and molecules that make up an immune system are going to be dependent upon their functional integration with uh their functional integration with an organism that dependence upon that functional organization is uh is it's something that is to be expected given where that where immune system or the cells that make up the immune system how are they related to the larger the larger encompassing kind of system so um relative to the organism in which you find immune cells or immune systems uh those immune cells are not going to actually be more autonomous than that system within which in there with right so that's uh that in that sense uh if you can start comparing levels of autonomy in that sense you'll have differences of course these are happening the auton the actions the behaviors if you will of these systems are going to be having it on different time scales however when you're just kind of thinking about uh whether or not the immune system could ever act in its own accord or for its own accord uh that's something that I think uh gives you a kind of quite direct answer as to whether or not immune systems are going to be uh you know targets for cognitive explanation which I don't think they are uh lastly a collective memory so the at the level of something like a colony so uh here's three reasons why I think an an Colony might be viewed as a metabolic individual it's made up of hetrogeneous Parts again uh you have differentiation of colony members have the queen of course the reproductive function of the queen but then you have workers uh which are all sisters um I just like bees in the sense uh and they have their all the functional allocations you're going to have different types of phenotypes within the colony uh and they maintain a particular Colonial structure uh that is going to be dependent over the turnover of individual ants now there's the high degree of metabolic integration between these parts um uh different ants are going to actually uh retrieve food and forage Feed The Colony feed the nests feed the feed the feed the queen uh and that metabolic integration is dependent upon each of the parts fitting together and functioning together cooperatively now there's going to be a small degree of non-cooperation or uh with within col within any Colony but that's going to be overshadowed by a Cooperative behavior um lastly you have integration uh which is going to be underwritten by external signals like again phermones and phone trails uh and behavior so entering and exiting the nest at a certain type of rate uh so it really doesn't in this case again uh like phum it really doesn't matter if the signals are internal or external uh these these signals are going to be used the way that they're used again the way they function is going to be analogous to internal signals uh so is collective memory subject to cognitive explanation uh in a non-instrumental way as a cognitive process I think assuming that there isn't any type of system that is in encompassing an ant colony uh that scores higher than the colony in terms of metabolic individuality uh I think an an an ant colony is going to be in this case where it's going to be maybe equal to the individual an on occasion this is this is a dynamic obviously a dynamic process uh but it's it might be equal to the individual an the individual organism so colonies come close having come close to having a similar score enough to regard them as something that we can ask the question or apply literally cognitive theories to an colonies and I think this is the this this kind of butresses this idea of colonial intelligence a colonial memory Colonial learning so that's that so in summary um we can return to the question of vum again that was the kind of feram is our spring board here is it warranted to interpret pham's use of extracellular slime this mucco polysaccharide is a form of biological memory I want to say yes we're warranted in thinking about it in terms of memory can such a memory be investigated from the perspective of cognitive memory can we apply cognitive explanations to it I'm going to say yeah sure uh ferum is an organism organisms are again parag gimatic forms of memory uh me memory kind of um ex they exhibit memory in a very paradigmatic way that we've seen in uh with within the talk and I believe that uh F obviously is going to be a metabolic individual for that reason so we can ask the third question is external L spatial memory a form of cognition uh and I say perhaps I I'll leave it at that perhaps because this is going to depend again if we can apply cognitive theories specifically navigational theories of memory uh and learning to forum's case because it is the highest degree has the highest degree of metabolic individual individuality of its biological organizational levels uh that's going to depend upon the different types of navigational theories that we apply so that third question is going really be it's going to be Theory dependent it's going to be framework dependent whether or not that's going to happen uh melan for example uh he suggested that these are three different types of criteria for spatial memory or navigational memory you have to have survival relevant storage which means that information that gets stored is going to be determined by the relevance of that information to the survival of the individual now that again goes very well with the idea of a metabolic individual and a persister uh number two for something to qualify spatial memory there has to be instability over time so uh the obvious way to think about this is memories can be forgotten they can be overwritten a memory that can't be overwritten no matter what type of substrate that memory is in uh doesn't seem to be something like a memory uh it it can't it can't the it doesn't have the Dynamics of a memory uh and lastly there's something like meta memory He suggests that you know spatial memory or navigational memory should should be should be core this this a core feature of it which just means that there are other processes that are going to influence whether memory states are AC or ignored uh in favor of guiding Behavior with uh the current context and whether or not these all are by ferum this is a question but now we get to the the point where we can ask these specific types of questions from a cognitive theory apply it to a particular type of individual because that individual seems to uh you know kind of it seems to be a kind of the highest degree of met have the highest degree of metabolic individuality a relative degree of metabol metabolic individuality so uh in conclusion regardless of whether pham's use of extracellular slime is considered a cognitive process or not you know again that's going to be Theory dependent it should be clear that focusing on the behavior of the single cell non- neuronal organism is going to be quite helpful and revealing interesting and important questions about memory and it can help us consider relations between different forms of biological memory so uh again if cognition is first and foremost a biological process and biological organism uh approaching this particular this this idea of cognitive explanations using non- neuronal model organisms like theerum it's going to offer a really promising way I think uh of going forward a potential escape from the trap or the you know the prison of our own kind of familiarity and I think that's a really important thing as to have model organisms that are so different from us that it stretches the imagination if you will but stretches the imagination in ways that you know uh expands our Horizons and the types of the different types of questions we can ask and that help us to kind of reflect on our own case or cases that are more similar to us thank you thank you awesome all right well while uh some people may be writing any questions in the live chat I believe the previous time we discussed was in live stream 30 it was how to count biological Minds symbiosis the free energy principle and reciprocal multiscale integration so some of those topics definitely came back into play ranging from the metabolic symbiosis and and the multiscale nesting where do you see active inference and the free energy principle in this line of research well I think I think it's an interesting way to model this this most certainly interesting way to model it and I think the particular idea of uh taking metabolism and taking different levels of metabolic integration seriously is something that uh I don't know it's something that I wasn't really I was thinking about it previously in how to count biological mind how to count IAL lli yes but um I didn't really understand the importance of this as an evolutionary process as as the importance to it as being kind of the result of an evolutionary process and once you have these taking this into consideration uh it uh you do have a a manner of a manner of kind of delineating where the targets going to be or where where the most important targets going to be so you can apply for example active inference to any level you can apply it to any level uh but some levels are going to be more interesting than others and I think uh because it is a type of you know active it's a type of process Theory and it's a type of kind of modeling framework uh it's you're free to kind of choose which levels you want to you want to apply it to however there are going to be some levels that are going to be more um should I say this they're going to they're going to actually have more of a payoff when you start applying other types of cognitive theories to I think particularly when you start thinking about uh uh not literally nesting but I would say contextualizing those theories within something like uh you know uh thinking about major transitions in cognitive Evolution or you thinking about major transitions more generally uh but cognitive theories putting putting like that those those particular types of cognitive theories in the context of uh you know Evolution if if one thinks about cognition as being something a kind of Suite or a toolbox of various capacities that have evolved and one doesn't just you know take on the Assumption uh that you know all life is cognitive which some people do but then that question becomes whether or not you know it's not a question about how cognition evolved necessarily but uh it's a question about how life evolved those two questions become the same question yeah awesome like the cognitive turn in evolutionary biology leads us almost to the point of asking well what remains other than cognitive account is the vend diagram of the cognitive accounts if we take it down to the materials level or ultimately identical with the biological account like es or or the metabolic all of the substrate of living systems is part of the building up and breaking down of metabolism so then you know what what is outside of that scope like how how many different frames and and and maybe no need to reduce to one but point to the the the um same cell in in the petri dish um I'll ask a question in the live chat okay Gia maximalist wrote thank you how do you think the metabolism of different sized organisms relates to their perception of time or their own behavior it's an interesting really interesting question um I think metabolism can run in an organism and I'm quite sure I would be quite sure about this CL metabolism can run uh without an organism being necessarily aware of anything it's at a certain level that we can actually have a particular type of uh like understanding if you will of our metabolism but metabolism nonetheless will affect uh will affect perception it will affect uh kind of how organisms behave uh and it will affect probably uh their Pro preception uh and uh depending upon uh because it's it's about kind of value tradeoffs if you will so uh if metabolism for example if if if if an organism is uh in a state that where metabolism is the function of metabolism is breaking down there going to be certain type of you know stress responses that occur that will affect the manner in which an organism behaves that's quite that's quite simple uh at which level an organism actually is aware that that's happening that's a different question and I'm not I'm not sure exactly where that happens that you have to have a quite complex uh neuronal system for that to happen but even before you get to that complex neuronal system uh you know complex nervous system even a brain you're going to have certain types of mechanisms in place that are going to be able to uh bring an organism back into its homeostatic range that bringing it back into that homeostatic range is uh as something that I would be very certain that most organisms if not all organisms have to do in order to Rive cool also there's interesting connection ctions like with the metabolic individuality you focused on that primary persistence and then even molecules or processes that are thought of as almost reaching into the Semitic like neurotransmitters sometimes are amino acids or just several modifications away so the line between what's uh metabolite and what is a a semiochemical they are also overlapping because metabolites are key signaling molecules um yeah maybe just to your book like what do you hope the impact of such a book is or H how did you come to think we need a slime mold and philosophy book and who would read it and think what yeah well I I was quite lucky at one point in time uh I got in touch with Mike Lin and Mike uh was you really he's he's Michael is fantastic person brilliant guy and it's fantastic person and he like ask me okay like you've been writing a little bit about you know ferum you've been writing about s have have you got your hands dirty yet have you started doing experiments I'm like no not at all I said like okay well let's let's change that so Mike sent me some protocol for culturing for zerum and took me step by step uh with a lot of a lot of communication with him as to how to do this and how to set up some experimental designs I had been you know uh about year and a half prior to that I was over in Rome with giovan pulo uh learning how to design uh kind of Behavioral experiments and how Mike was the one that kind of like you know reshift my focus from you know human behavioral experiments to behavioral experiments in a p dis and the more I got doing the these particular types of experiments nothing published not not anything yet anyway um uh the more I was thinking about what an incredible way to kind of uh ask or answer questions that a lot of a lot of questions that have been happening or arising in kind of theoretical biology or philosophy of biology you just don't you don't you know there are a lot of what ifs a lot of contrafactual a lot of you know speculation that happens uh but given the ease with which this particular type of organism can be cultivated or cultured given uh the speed at which it moves and also uh you know given the what actually can do it's quite unique as to what it can actually uh the behavior that it engages in uh there are a lot of things that you can proceed to a lot of questions that you can proceed to ask and just answer uh and so I haven't had the time uh or necessarily the resources to sit down for five years and answer all these questions myself with people in the lab um but uh at BAM uh R University I was given the chance to work with a couple people uh one is her name is uh true rang and she's uh she's a post off there and she's doing she was working on kind of um uh recording climbing plants and doing analysis of climbing plant um uh kind of climbing plant Behavior Uh I don't know if you've seen of course you've seen kind of recordings of plant tendrils as they kind of grow and wrap around Vines they wrap their kind of tendrils around certain poles and things like this and she was doing uh kinematic analysis of that and we decided to actually uh use that same type of analysis with ferum uh looking at its growth looking at its movement uh and in response to certain things so uh I was very very very very lucky to uh make her acquaintance and be able to work with her um but I thought okay well prior to this there's no way that I can do this myself or all of it myself it's an intensive it's a really intensive research program there's so many questions that can be asked and I think part of the part of the fun of it uh and I think part of the value of it is asking the questions and maybe inspiring people who want to want to answer these questions in the lab uh to give give give them a couple kind of questions to kind of uh you know to use as a fcr if you will uh and to get philosophers of biology philosophers philosophers of C science uh and biologists microbiologists together in one space uh to work together and perhaps think about these questions and and use resources uh you know to answer these questions if you will uh in a laboratory setting and so that's what the book is about pretty much it's like it's looking at Alum which is like it's it's an organism that I'm absolutely you know I'm I continue to be mesmerized by you know uh the the various things that it can do and just how how beautiful of of a life cycle it has uh and interesting of a life cycle that it has uh how it can be used to answer some questions from very very long-standing questions in the philosophy of biology and say philosophy of cognitive science also awesome that res resonates a lot I'll add a few points I'll begin with a quote from a 1989 paper a framework for plant Behavior by Silvertown and Gordon who you quoted and they wrote there's some question whether words used to describe animal behavior such as the word Behavior itself or foraging can be properly applied to the activities of plants so it's kind of this Evergreen discussion oh okay but is it really solving that maze or or is it really memory and certainly Mike Levin and and others and these come up like is anything that's outside of the organismal frame actually doing cognition and then the slime mold blurs that because it's also a single cell so then it's like well why would it matter if there's a lipid membrane separating this or that when the cell is also the organismal boundary and then also to the relevance and sort of the cross fertilization of philosophy of biology and the behavioral sciences or ethology in Professor Gordon's undergraduate class one thing that she would have the undergraduates do was design and carry out a behavioral experiment even you know do squirrels cross the bike path more on Wednesdays and there's something about doing any inquiry that provides philosophical insights that that the armchair doesn't and it helps reveal there's a associative analogical mode that's like studying foraging across different systems however by virtue of thinking and scoping over so many systems most are not going to be directly engaged with you know we're thinking about like a space hypothetical asteroid forager and um ants as a broad category but then when you get into the natural history and the Behavioral Science or the constraints of a specific laboratory just sticking with one system like a dropa or slime mold or this one field site those can offer so many questions that even leads to reinter ation of what the bigger category like navigation was so for example like in the in the navigation example or the maze solving I thought well it's doing something spatial but not necessarily with a cognitive map so right what is does now it's like hm so actually there's some play between what is cognition that's realized spatially and that which is aware of its own spatiality and that's something that can just be brought to bear with a petri dish and some experiments like that so it's just when the philosophy questions are held up with the inquiry there's just amazing possibilities and like you're what you shared shows that you know people come from both sides and and um may it be a perforated membrane between the two because there's so much to like learn on both sides Absolut absolutely absolutely I think this like you hit the nail on the head it's just um I take it then that you were you were in uh Deborah's Gordon's class then did you take courses for her she was my PhD adviser ah of course fantastic that make sense makes a lot of she she's incredible she's really incredible um so yeah I I think that you you hit the nail or the head with many many of the things that you just said um in terms of say spatial navigation uh yeah ferum not going to have a cognitive map not going to have a cognitive map and this is I think like a I think cognitive maps are quite complex things that there's still disagreements as to whether or not you know uh which organisms use cognitive Maps uh again Sarah shuttleworth 2014 she really kind of puts the breakes on and say if you can explain this a lot of what organisms do animals do she's a she's an ethologist uh in terms of using certain types of uh you know other simpler mechanisms uh that they're still they're still quite complex cognitively but they simpler mechanisms in comp Maps uh running computations on comp Maps um uh you have you have these things going on in ants for example where you have like entric or versus allocentric kind of recognition of landmarks and things of that nature or um you probably know this the term better than me but dead reckoning uh using dead reckoning dead reckoning is distinct from using a cognitive map it probably can be used in addition in animals with cognitive Maps uh but the question then arises in phum is there something similar to dead reing happening is there something similar to Landmark navigation happening is it leaving its own Landmark something like this you can ask these question start to ask these questions uh because you can relate Its Behavior Uh to other types of cognitive theories if you have the right if you're asking the right level if you're at the right level you know uh so yeah it's not going to satisfy any any of the kind of Criterion if you will for thinking about cognitive Maps but maybe Landmark use perhaps you know Landmark use does not necessarily have to be a personal process it can be a subpersonal process I think it's a pader quote like computers don't play chess they do statistics but they don't do statistics they just follow the laws of physics and all of that it's like cognitive phenomena when we start to really interrogate them and break them apart oh well that outfielder is not really inferring the location of the ball they're just using a behavioral heris to stand where it's going to it's like well if that's actually how it's done then what is the space between the problem as it was set up and how it's really being done in all these different biological ways so and that even came up in the reciprocal integration like what do we expect what are we surprised by what what does what we're surprised by say about who and how we think we are in how we analyze these cognitive systems um I'll ask a last last uh question from the live chat upcycle Club wrote how might the Adaptive behaviors of slime molds contribute to our understanding of distributed cognition okay that's a good that's a good question I think it relates back to I would have I would have to say really very important work by Chris Reed uh and his colleagues over at mcer University the first paper that I referred to you to the 2012 paper about externalized spatial memory uh or externalized navigational memory is I think that's a good place to start with that in terms of uh an organism that uses its own byproducts to navigate uh it uses its own byproducts uh you know again this is not this is not a personal level kind of choice or anything like this but I should say this I think this is quite important in terms of understanding the nature of it once we get to say okay well this is the right level for looking at memory this is perhaps the right level for looking at the organismal level or biological organizational level for thinking about things like problem solving decision making and so on and so forth its use of extracellular slime which again is a mucco polysaccharide it can be overridden so it's not just a repulsion to this stuff uh if you create a situation in a Petri dish where you have a circle of extra this is one of the experiments I've done and you put a pharum in that Circle uh and then you put a reasonably sized oat flake which that's something that you use as kind of um uh it's for food in order for motivation um it will it'll climb over the Excell line it'll and that's one of the things that I think is quite important uh and thinking about and that was one of the kind of criteria also about kind of spatial memory or navigational memory uh that was brought up in the talk uh that something can be overridden given the particular type of context I would think there are many other ways that you can expand this when you can ask the question when does it use this extra slim and what does it use EXT extracellular sign for is it is it just uh you know again is it just a a lubricant for uh motility no we know that kind of uses it for navigation what in what ways does it use it for navigation and does it always have to be in contact with it is are there gradients or there there many questions that could be asked but the I guess the most important thing to think about is the fact that whatever is going on it's it's a coupling of a cell to Something in its external milu and depending upon the geometry of that extracellular SL depending upon the values of various stimuli within its surrounds that it can sense again it's it's it's sensing these various it's sensing food for example uh through concentration gradients uh and through AAR that are going through the AAR whether it's going to be oats or sugar from oats that are kind of leaking sleeping into the AAR or whether it's in its own natural environment uh it can do this particular Ty these I'll call them computations if you will on uh what's available and what's more important uh for this particular type of context uh and exor slime plays a plays a role in that in the sense that uh it's one of the things that it weighs in these particular types of computations now the computations again might be very very very very simple uh but there their computations that are being run because it's in the integration of information and the weighing out of this information according to uh according to kind of the continuation of metabolic functioning when things don't work out then it goes into one of these dormant stages and can reemerge after waiting things out but that's uh extracellular slime plays a very very important role so again the suggestion look at the work of Chris Reed um read it Al 2012 2013 and it's a very good starting place to understand how ferum uses extracellular Slim in these ways I'm also struck by when you showed the life cycle diagram and how it seems like less is known about what cognitive tasks or work is done in those other stages and then also how different they looked from a size and morphology and it just is like what what we you know the the caterpillar and the larvae and the Butterfly all do different things and so when we think about the life cycle perspective and communic there's so many cool ways to go well if you have any last comments please go for it otherwise it's a great direction of research and it's exciting to see how the cognitive Sciences are entering the chat and bringing a lot of excitement to these perennial questions about individuality and cognition I think so much yeah I think in terms of life cycles I think there's something fun that um and and very important that goes on uh one of the things that has uh beset I said I suppose biological research a lot of biological research and specifically you know thinking about cognition is that we're adults interests uh we think about the adult organism you know of course there's development of psychology and kind of people are looking at that but most a lot of the research when we're talking about generalizing certain types of capacities of generalizing certain type of uh you know uh response rates uh we have a very kind of narrow band of model organisms and ages of model organisms that we're looking at uh this even when you look at an organism with a complex life cycle uh you expand that in such an incredible way because you're not just looking at different ages you're looking at different uh really really different phenotypes within the same organism over over over time and not only are you looking at different phenotypes uh you're looking at and this is one of the things that I approach in the book It's a Wonderful way to explore something like nich construction uh because if those different parts of the life cycle are responses to changes in the environment their responses to various selection pressures uh ways to accommodate selection pressures sometimes they might happen uh they might be primed by certain types of stimuli sometimes not uh then you have a different kind of frame uh that one can use to think about Niche construction various types of Niche construction and how they're related so yeah a beaver the you know the stereotypical example of the beaver building and that uh to kind of control the Dynamics within its particular type of Niche uh you have that like that's a particular type of externalized n construction uh but then you have other things which involve for example uh an organism changing its own morphology uh as a way to kind of uh buffer itself from changes in selection pressures harder selection pressure so a change change in a change in temperature it might be a change in for example moisture so the mix amoeba can you know it will will synthesize fella by flatulate if there's if it if it starts raining if there's a lot of water then those those it'll stop synthesizing those fella and start falling again as an amoeba as uh if if it dries out again right and there's there kind of costs like the costs of that particular type of morphological change or that type of Niche construction are quite interesting things to think about because when it's uh a bagate uh there it's it can't reproduce so there's a trade-off there when it's a mix amiba when it's reproducing it can't feed so uh there there very interesting way to think about a life history tradeoffs plus Niche construction and and you get all of that with an if you focus rather than on just the just the plasmodium cell that we've been talking about during this that we've been focusing on on this talk on entire life cycle and there many other organisms uh Brites for example ferns uh you know incredible incredible life cycles that you know they behavior is different in and and obviously in in bof fights or or plants or whatever but but the the same goes for them in the sense that uh you have that that life cycle provides a really beautiful way a beautiful lens through which to see uh how an individual's morphology is very much coupled in in in incredible ways to different environmental Dynamics and how it can actually influence those Dynamics and influence its own evolution epic okay thank you Matt for joining again and looking forward to reading the book and till next time thanks man bye right
