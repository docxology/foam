# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Lab's live stream discusses the intersections of realism and instrumentalism in cognitive science and their implications for understanding self-modeling.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The Active Inference Lab focuses on online communication and practice related to active inference.
2. Participants introduced themselves, sharing diverse academic backgrounds in cognition and philosophy.
3. Key topics included realism, computationalism, instrumentalism, and their implications for cognitive science.
4. The importance of understanding self-modeling in relation to consciousness and cognitive processes was emphasized.
5. The discussion explored whether cognition is a static property or a dynamic system.
6. Free energy principle and active inference were highlighted as frameworks for understanding adaptive systems.
7. The relationship between the brain and self-awareness was a central question in the conversation.
8. There was a critique of using neural correlates to legitimize research in cognitive science.
9. The impact of philosophical perspectives on policy-making and social issues was discussed.
10. Future research will explore the dynamics of cognition and its implications for understanding behavior.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active Inference Lab fosters collaboration among diverse thinkers in cognitive science.
2. Realism and instrumentalism can coexist in understanding cognitive phenomena.
3. The dynamics of cognition should be prioritized over static representations.
4. Free energy principle provides a useful framework for studying adaptive systems.
5. Understanding self-modeling can enhance our grasp of consciousness and agency.
