# SUMMARY
Active Inference Lab hosts a live discussion (15.2) on realism, computationalism, and instrumentalism, featuring multiple researchers sharing insights and perspectives.

# IDEAS:
- The distinction between realism and instrumentalism can impact understanding of scientific models in cognitive science.
- Active inference applies to adaptive systems, influencing how we model cognition and behavior.
- Understanding cognition requires addressing complex dynamics rather than static representations in science.
- The brain's perceived agency may lead to misinterpretation of its functions and capabilities.
- Free energy principle offers a framework for understanding the behavior of adaptive systems.
- Models should capture idiosyncratic activity patterns instead of rigidly defined cognitive properties.
- Cognitive behavior emerges from interactions within an adaptive environment and is not static.
- Perception of self is influenced by social constructs and interactions with others.
- The concept of Markov blankets provides a statistical tool for understanding system boundaries.
- The philosophical baggage of science influences public perception and acceptance of scientific findings.
- Instrumentalism allows flexibility in modeling without committing to a realist interpretation.
- Social policies should focus on addressing injustices rather than getting entangled in philosophical debates.
- The evolution of scientific understanding can lead to misconceptions in public discourse about topics like gender.
- Scientific models can serve as tools for communication and understanding rather than definitive truths.
- Neuroimaging findings should be interpreted in the context of broader behavioral patterns and dynamics.
- Active inference can bridge gaps between philosophical discussions and practical applications in policy-making.

# INSIGHTS:
- The interplay between realism and instrumentalism shapes our understanding of cognitive science and behavior.
- Models of cognition should prioritize dynamic interactions over static representations for better understanding.
- Clarifying the distinction between different types of knowledge can enhance policy-making and public understanding.
- The free energy principle provides a versatile framework for analyzing adaptive systems across disciplines.
- Philosophical debates on identity and reality can hinder practical advancements in understanding human behavior.
- Emphasizing behavioral patterns over rigid categorizations can lead to more inclusive and effective policies.
- Understanding cognition requires acknowledging the role of social constructs in shaping self-perception.
- The relationship between the brain and behavior is complex and should not be oversimplified.
- Engaging in interdisciplinary dialogue can enrich scientific discussions and lead to innovative solutions.
- Acknowledging the limitations of our models fosters a more nuanced approach to understanding complex phenomena.

# QUOTES:
- "There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination."
- "Cognition is a construct that is in the eye of the scientists."
- "Our models should capture the dynamics of cognitive behavior instead of merely describing static properties."
- "Cognition is observed in behavior and not a fixed structure in a closed system."
- "We can apply the Markov blanket as a statistical tool to whichever level of description we are interested in studying."
- "What matters is not whether categories are real but whether they effectively address patterns of injustice."
- "The distinction between realism and instrumentalism can impact understanding of scientific models in cognitive science."
- "The free energy principle applies to adaptive systems and can explain their behavior."
- "Philosophical debates on identity and reality can hinder practical advancements in understanding human behavior."
- "Scientific models can serve as tools for communication and understanding rather than definitive truths."
- "Perception of self is influenced by social constructs and interactions with others."
- "Models should prioritize dynamic interactions over static representations for better understanding."
