# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Lab discusses Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes, emphasizing the interplay between sensory and active states within Markov blankets.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Lab focuses on applied active inference and Bayesian mechanics discussions.
2. Participants include authors and researchers interested in machine learning and neuroscience.
3. The Markov blanket represents the boundary between internal and external states.
4. Bayesian mechanics describes stochastic processes using principles of free energy minimization.
5. Internal states infer external states based on sensory information via the Markov blanket.
6. The paper addresses criticisms of the Free Energy Principle and its mathematical foundations.
7. Solenoidal flow enhances convergence to free energy minima in stochastic systems.
8. Partitioning blanket states into sensory and active states aids in understanding action and inference.
9. Active states represent the dynamic response of a system to incoming sensory information.
10. Future work will explore how state spaces change over time in biological systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. The Markov blanket is crucial for understanding the relationship between internal and external states.
2. Bayesian mechanics can model complex systems using principles of free energy and stochastic processes.
3. Active states provide insights into how organisms interact with their environment through action.
4. Solenoidal flow allows for more efficient convergence in systems with noise and complexity.
5. Future research will deepen our understanding of dynamic changes in state spaces and representations.
