# SUMMARY
Active Inference Lab's livestream 36.2 discusses the paper by Sims and Pizzulo on the Free Energy Principle and representation.

# IDEAS:
- The Free Energy Principle (FEP) reveals implicit notions of representation in cognitive science.
- The discussion includes the complexity of organizational and structural representation in cognition.
- Non-representational and representational forms can emerge from cognitive processes dynamically.
- Active inference allows for exploration of self-representation at individual and lab scales.
- The debate on realism versus instrumentalism in active inference remains prominent in cognitive science.
- Cognitive agents can transition between representational and non-representational frameworks during interactions.
- Understanding representation informs how cognitive entities model their environment and each other.
- Conversations between individuals illustrate the dynamics of organizational representation and cognitive asymmetry.
- The functional role of representations influences how agents make predictions and decisions.
- Autopoiesis emphasizes the self-maintaining nature of cognitive agents through information sharing.
- Exploring sensory-motor engagement can lead to novel ways of understanding representation.
- The FEP serves as a heuristic to navigate the complexities of cognitive representation debates.
- Cross-disciplinary perspectives contribute to enriching discussions about representation in cognitive science.
- Misunderstandings in conversation can arise from differing structural representations between individuals.
- The distinction between content-related and functional representations is crucial for cognitive modeling.
- The paper serves as a meta-analysis of the ongoing discourse on representation in cognitive science.

# INSIGHTS:
