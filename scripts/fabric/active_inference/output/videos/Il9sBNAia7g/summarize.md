# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The lecture discusses how space-time emerges from information processing, challenging reductionist views and introducing scale-free theories in physics.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Space-time is considered emergent rather than fundamental in quantum information and gravity communities.
2. Quantum information theory emphasizes connectivity over geometric assumptions of space-time.
3. Free energy principle relates to unitarity, highlighting the complexity of communication between agents.
4. Scale-free theories propose that both micro and macro systems follow the same laws and dynamics.
5. Object persistence and translational invariance are key concepts for understanding spatial organization.
6. Time is observed before space, as organisms can detect periodic behavior without spatial awareness.
7. A coordinate system requires a fixed origin, allowing for the labeling of segments in an environment.
8. Godel's theorem indicates limitations in creating consistent and complete theories for self-referential systems.
9. The relationship between scales in biology may mirror quantum and information theoretic constructs.
10. The Free Energy Principle underscores the importance of semantics in modeling agents interacting with their environment.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. The emergence of space-time challenges traditional reductionist scientific views.
2. Understanding information processing is crucial for grasping the nature of reality.
3. Scale-free theories can provide deeper insights into complex systems and their interactions.
4. Observations in biology can inform theories of physics, particularly regarding space and time.
5. The Free Energy Principle emphasizes that agents actively model their environments, not merely observe.
