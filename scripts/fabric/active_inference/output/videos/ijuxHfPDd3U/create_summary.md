# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Team Com's discussion explored active inference, communication dynamics, attunement, attention, and their implications for learning and collaboration.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Team Com is an experiment in online communication and learning related to active inference.
2. The discussion followed up on previous conversations about human communication as active inference.
3. Participants shared personal experiences influencing their communication styles during remote interactions.
4. Communication can be cooperative, competitive, or adversarial, impacting outcomes and relationships.
5. Attunement in communication requires alignment of mental states between experienced and inexperienced individuals.
6. Ostensive cues signal the intent to communicate and can enhance attention in conversations.
7. Attention has two components: epistemic value (knowledge gain) and precision weighting (data accuracy).
8. Free energy informs policy decisions by tracking the likelihood of actions based on expected outcomes.
9. Exploring and exploiting strategies are essential for effective communication and collaboration.
10. Mathematical models can formalize communication dynamics, enhancing understanding of attention and alignment.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding active inference can improve team communication and learning.
2. Attunement in communication is crucial for effective interactions and collaboration.
3. The distinction between epistemic value and precision weighting helps clarify attention dynamics.
4. Effective communication strategies should incorporate both exploration and exploitation.
5. Future discussions could benefit from exploring mathematical models of attention and communication.
