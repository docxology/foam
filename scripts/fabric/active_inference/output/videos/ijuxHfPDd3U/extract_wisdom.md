# SUMMARY
The discussion is a follow-up on active inference in communication, featuring participants Yvonne, Alex, and Shannon, exploring insights on communication dynamics and implications.

# IDEAS:
- Active inference emphasizes how communication is a continuous process of reducing uncertainty about mental states.
- Cooperative communication may shift to competitive based on context, impacting interaction dynamics.
- Online communication can lead to sensory overload, complicating effective engagement in large groups.
- The absence of individuals in meetings can influence the overall communication ecology and outcomes.
- Communication is non-linear, meaning outcomes can vary significantly based on participants' presence.
- Attunement between communicators is essential for effective understanding and collaboration.
- The dynamics of communication involve both verbal and non-verbal cues that influence perception.
- Epistemic value and precision weighting are two distinct types of attention affecting communication.
- Human communication is characterized by a desire for mental state alignment with others.
- Miscommunication risks can arise from varying levels of experience and understanding among participants.
- Attention governance can help manage communication effectiveness in team settings.
- Ostensive cues serve as signals to direct attention towards important information during communication.
- Cultural contexts can shape the ways attention is directed and managed in communication.
- The interplay of exploration and exploitation in communication strategies influences decision-making.
- Narrative attunement is crucial for collaborative efforts and achieving shared goals among teams.
- The quality of communication can significantly impact team dynamics and project outcomes.
- Understanding the mechanics of communication can lead to better practices in collaborative environments.

# INSIGHTS:
- Communication is fundamentally a process of reducing uncertainty about shared mental states.
- Cooperative communication can evolve into competition, highlighting context's role in interactions.
- Large group settings present unique challenges for maintaining effective communication and attention.
- The presence or absence of individuals influences the dynamics and outcomes of group communication.
- Effective communication relies on both verbal and non-verbal signals for understanding.
- Attunement is critical for ensuring mutual understanding and collaboration between communicators.
- Attention can be categorized into epistemic value and precision weighting, affecting engagement.
- Humans possess an intrinsic drive for mental state alignment, influencing communication effectiveness.
- Miscommunication risks increase with varying experiences and understanding among team members.
- Governing attention strategically can enhance communication effectiveness in collaborative settings.

# QUOTES:
- "Human infants only appear satisfied following a communicative bid when their own communicative partner has aligned their mental states."
- "Communication is so non-additive, it's non-linear... a different emerging outcome when somebody isn't there."
- "There's big differences between being with three people in a room and 40 people in a room."
- "Cooperative communication could be competitive in some situations."
- "The feeling of cooperation and turn-taking can be hijacked or used non-cooperatively."
- "It seems like communication would have to have signs of cooperativity at every stage along the way."
- "There are opportunities for signal error; can the longevity of cooperation be assessed by goodness of fit?"
- "The internal states are reflected by the KL divergence, which is the informational divergence between the priors and the posterior."
- "Epistemic value, salience, or affordance is the component of policy selection that tracks how much a policy reduces uncertainty."
- "Imprecise sensory data should have less effect on Bayesian belief updating relative to precise information."
- "Free energy expected under a policy tracks the probability of that particular policy being pursued."
- "The two terms are epistemic value and pragmatic value, quantifying exploration and exploitation."
- "Ostensive cues are a way to let other people know that we're intending to communicate."
- "Attention governance can help manage communication effectiveness in team settings."
- "Communication is fundamentally relational; it's all about those edges between nodes."
- "Each individual agent unpacks narratives in ways that make sense to them."

# HABITS:
- Regularly check in with team members to assess understanding and alignment in communication.
- Utilize ostensive cues to signal important information during discussions.
- Practice active listening to enhance attunement and comprehension in conversations.
- Conduct frequent feedback sessions to improve communication dynamics and strategies.
- Encourage open dialogue to address and clarify miscommunication risks within teams.
- Implement structured meetings to manage attention and maintain focus on key topics.
- Foster an environment that values both exploration and exploitation in communication strategies.
- Emphasize the importance of narrative attunement to achieve shared goals among team members.
- Create a culture of respect and patience during communication exchanges.
- Use visual aids or summaries to enhance clarity and understanding in discussions.

# FACTS:
