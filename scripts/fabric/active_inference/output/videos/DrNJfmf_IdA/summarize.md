# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Cohort one discusses chapter 10, focusing on active inference, generative models, learning processes, and implications for future research.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active engagement enhances learning through predictions and actions in the world.
2. GPT models do not select their own training inputs, limiting their learning capacity.
3. Reinforcement learning provides feedback through sample selection but has its limitations.
4. Statistical regularities in environments influence generative model construction.
5. The concept of "should" reflects expectations and preferences in cognitive processes.
6. Evolutionary constraints impact the development of generative models in organisms.
7. Agential realism defines agency as relationships between objects, not just organisms.
8. Understanding generative models requires context from generative processes and evolutionary history.
9. The distinction between sentience and agency is crucial in active inference discussions.
10. Future research may bridge gaps in understanding generative models and their applications.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active engagement is essential for effective learning and model updating.
2. The limitations of existing models highlight the need for improved input selection strategies.
3. Evolutionary perspectives can inform the design of generative models in AI.
4. Clarity in definitions of agency and sentience is necessary for meaningful discussions.
5. Collaborative discussions with authors could enhance understanding of complex topics.
