# IDEAS

- Active Inference Lab focuses on team communication, learning, and practice around active inference.
- Introductions and warm-up questions help participants engage before the main presentation.
- Chris Fields discusses a paper about context, written with Jim Glasbrook, related to autism.
- Active inference framework connects internal and external states via sensory and active states.
- The theory of active inference has a rich history rooted in robotics and ethology.
- Classical physics language is unsuitable for discussing active inference; a quantum theory perspective is proposed.
- Active inference involves perception and cognition from a physics perspective, focusing on observation.
- Contextuality relates to the effects of unknown contextual variables on measurements.
- The frame problem in AI connects to predicting side effects of actions.
- Quantum theory introduces the concept of separability, crucial for understanding interactions in systems.
- The relationship between quantum states and classical physics impacts how we understand boundaries in systems.
- The dynamics of a system will erase imposed boundaries over time, affecting separability.
- Information flow in quantum theory requires energy, challenging the classical observer-detached model.
- The interaction between systems can be described by thermodynamics and binary outcomes in quantum theory.
- Reference frames determine the semantics of information exchanged between systems.
- Contextuality can lead to undefined joint probability distributions in quantum systems.
- Active inference may apply to social systems, indicating potential for broader applications of quantum concepts.
- Experimentation in social contexts can reveal insights about individual and collective decision-making processes.
- Play and exploration are vital for discovering learnable aspects of the environment.
- Language and communication act as tools for embedding context and understanding in complex systems.
- The mind's relationship to language suggests that thought may be shaped by social and cultural contexts.
- Multicellularity and cooperation in biological systems illustrate the concept of shared information and resources.
- The concept of the extended organism highlights interconnectedness and shared cognitive processes in communities.
- Biomimicry can inspire approaches to address contemporary challenges by learning from biological systems.
