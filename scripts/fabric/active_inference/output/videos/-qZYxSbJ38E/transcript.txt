[Music] all right hello and welcome this is active lab live stream number 40.0 it's march 10th 2022. welcome to the active lab we're a participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us at the links here on the slide this is recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams check out activeinference.org to learn more about the lab all right in today's number 40.0 the goal is to learn and discuss this very cool paper that was published on archive on december 30th 2021 a free energy principle for generic quantum systems by chris fields carl fristen james f glazebrook and michael levin and just like every video it's going to be just a conversation going over some parts of the paper it's not a review or a final word and if anything it's um a cry for help or at least a cry for participation because there's so many areas where somebody with different experience or more knowledge about any of these domains could connect some dots or give some useful comments or critiques so especially with this video though blue and i had help from our colleague jason larkin with many of the details there's just so much to unpack so we'll try to make this a useful dot zero and then we're really looking forward to the dot one and dot two and so on when we'll be able to really go into some of these directions so i hope if you're watching live or between now and the dot one check out the paper and listen to this discussion that we'll have now and ask some questions because this is just the beginning of a few new threads probably more than the answering of questions especially to any desired level of like completeness or applicability so it's just the beginning that's what the dot zero is about it's a new decade 40.0 so um we'll just uh introduce yourself and then go through a bunch of the paper and yeah thanks again to jason for a lot of help in blue for awesome work on the slides too okay so um i'm daniel i'm a researcher in california and i'll pass to blue as facilitator blue knight i'm a researcher in new mexico and i have to shout out to daniel too because you're always saying thank you to me but you know we all have to say thank you to you for providing the affordances to be here and you know discuss these awesome questions um big paper i am uh excited to delve into this i think it will you know start a lot of new trails so i think um and also to bring back mike levin and to bring back chris fields um and to bring back carl firsten back to the active lab to discuss the dot one with us hopefully um okay so is there anything particular that you are excited about daniel or do you want to just power through it let's get let's jump in all right so this paper really was trying to unite um the quantum principles and the free energy principles so quantum mechanics and kind of delving into that and we will see some threads carry over from the last time that we had chris fields on here maybe the last time we had mike levin on here also um so how is the free energy principle related to quantum mechanics what does the fvp gain from quantum what does quantum gain from the fep are we using the fep now to model quantum systems and why are we pursuing this intersection so this was kind of like the big questions kind of maybe we can start to answer with this paper um so we are here daniel what's this map about um it's a question we're gonna probably ask ourselves multiple times so we can insert it like a little emoji but we can think of among the axes of variation or variability that we're going to explore or where we're going to tune our regime of attention or what perspectives we're going to take it's going to be like along two axes ranging from on the right side fep active like to the left side which is like pre or non active slash fep it's the x axis and the y axis is the continuum between quantum which we'll probably nuance and hear many perspectives of what isn't isn't quantum but just to summarize it by saying quantum and not quantum like pre or non-quantum approaches and so quantum fep is in the upper right corner and we can think of it as being like connected in different ways to quantum non-fep in the top left the blue and then fep but from a non-quantum perspective like all pre now fap active in green and then what are all the other connections and so who's right who's wrong who's useful where's their pragmatic value where is their epistemic value what are we really talking about do we agree on the phenomena where where is their agreement or disagreement where are we in this complex landscape so i think in mechanics we refer to it as classical mechanics and quantum mechanics so now we will be this is like the dividing point maybe between classical fep and quantum fdp perhaps let's see where it goes so the aims and claims of the paper there are pretty much three and we'll revisit these at the summary because we're going to just give you a broad overview of the summary of results right now given the standard free choice assumption the intuitive ideas of an agent or information gathering and using system igus can be fully formulated within background independent scale-free quantum information theory the second claim is that fep can be a quantum theoretic formulation that renders it applicable to generic quantum systems and do you want to read the last one daniel uh three when formulated as a generic principle of quantum information theory the fpp is asymptotically equivalent to the principle of unitarity cool do you want to read the first section of the abstract all right the free energy principle or fpp states that under suitable conditions of weak coupling random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will behave so as to minimize an upper bound formalized as a variational free energy on surprisable also known as self-information this upper bound can be read as a bayesian prediction error equivalently its negative is a lower bound on bayesian model evidence also known as marginal likelihood in short certain random dynamical systems events a certain kind of self-evidencing so here we reformulate the fep in the formal setting of space-time background-free scale-free quantum information theory we show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as observers which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes we show how such agents minimize bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by uncertainty insufficient learning and quantum contextuality we show that in its quantum theoretic formulation the fep is asymptotically equivalent to the principle of unitarity based on these results we suggest that biological systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and implicitly as a communication resource we summarize a number of problems for future research particularly involving the resources required for classical communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context switches it's like okay cool what does it mean how will it be useful yeah um so we're gonna unpack a lot of this and hopefully give everyone a good framework with which to kind of go forward into the dot one and dot two maybe a little bit of background understanding um the paper is very beefy so we'll do our best to kind of lay the framework down they give us a good road map so there's five sections the introduction physical interaction as information exchange and several subsections within that repeated measurements and system identification and subsections the fep for generic quantum systems and the discussion and i think that they actually outline what's in each section so we'll give you that outline overview as we go through the paper as well so just we're going to use we're going to actually reuse some slides from actin stream number 17 that was when we had chris fields presenting information flow in context dependent hierarchical bayesian inference i think contextuality is like an underlying thread that's pretty important here today so chris kind of lays that out in the um in that paper and so if you want to get into that and dive deeper into two spaces and channel theory which we'll talk about a little bit but um yeah that's there so use that for a resource just one foreshadowing here the two pieces that they claimed in this paper as their goals was to connect contextuality to category theory and shoe spaces and then connect that yellow formulation to hierarchical bayesian inference more looking like the statistical models and so this paper is kind of building a category theory bridge with bayesian graphs and statistics and category theory and then that's probably going to hinge over to a few other areas cool so we can jump right into the introduction um here and we're just going to highlight some keywords as we go through the authors didn't really give keywords for the paper um which i'm kind of grateful for because there's so much so many other things to unpack here so they um highlight some things about the fep in the words of the authors since its introduction is a theory of brain function the variational free energy principle has been extended into an explanatory framework for systems at all scales the fep is the statement that any measurable bounded and macroscopically system will behave to satisfy these requirements requirements what else daniel it was just cool how they brought in the fep as being the overarching level as describing how these particles do two things which is possess internal dynamics that are conditionally independent from the environment and performing this self-evidencing feature by returning to some non-equilibrium steady state and so just which parts of the fep they entered in at or emphasized which we can assume are setting the stage up in their mind best for the interfacing or the on-ramping into quantum where somebody interested in like a system or integration other than quantum might take a different approach cool i think that they borrow also from our particular physics and we're going to talk about particles and they talk more about particles in the discussion and maybe we can have a deeper conversation about those in the dot one and dot two but they say the markov boundary of any particle um that's an open exchange with external states via its markov boundary underwrites conditional independence between its internal states and the external states of its environment by localizing and thereby restricting information exchange so the markov boundary separates internal and external states by mediating their exchange we've seen that before cool so what is active inference daniel can you break it down for us two cents overview that blanket that blue just described with the insulation incoming statistical dependencies can be interpreted as perception and outgoing statistical dependencies can be interpreted as control and depending on the situation and what's zero and what's not zero that can have a lot of dynamics that are similar to some other classic settings in decision making gambling experimentation quantum measurement in this paper very cool uh so what is quantum theory um this is cool just some pictures and it's connected in to many many different uh fields so there's a cool kind of concept map of where quantum theory intersects um but you know the quantum theory here is the idea that that all physical systems can including the environment can be considered observers that act on their surroundings to prepare them for subsequent observations that's become common in quantum theory replacing the wave function collapse postulate of traditional quantum mechanics with interaction induced decoherence which is like the dissipation of quantum coherence this is like the thing that generates classical information and they say indeed while quantum theory was originally developed and it's still widely regarded as the theory specifically applicable at the atomic scale and below since the work of wheeler feynman and douche dutch douche it has over the past few decades been reformulated as a scale-free information theory and is increased increasingly viewed as a theory of the process of observation itself so um yeah i think like when we think about quantum we think about the observer at least i do like i think about the observer phenomenon just the act of observing a system changes the system so that's kind of a fundamental thing that comes to my mind what comes to your mind daniel when you think about quantum theory uh if reading that leaves me uncertain whether we're talking about like organic chemistry and the pi orbitals and covalent bonding and emission and all of those things that particles do which is what it sounds like they're talking about in this orange part a theory specifically applicable to the atomic scale and below and then this blue part makes it sound like they're opening it up into a much larger space so i think we'll probably learn a lot about that what does quantum mean here are we talking about electrons and protons or is this something that is like bayesian inference in that it's scale free or scale a priori or scale friendly or something like that nice scale independence so we're gonna jump right in so section two they talk a lot about physical interaction as information exchange and that's something i wonder also like is you know we have the classical mechanics and do the laws of quantum always apply or at some scale are they you know not applicable or can we extend them into some like theory of everything like are we getting there maybe but here in this section they say that they use the category theoretic formalism of channel theory to formalize the operational semantics of natural languages so they develop a generic formal representation of quantum reference frames and show how the non-commutativity of quantum reference frames induces quantum contextuality and i had fun really digging into this at a level that i felt comfortable explaining it so i'm excited to see if i if i fungal it or how it goes let's see okay what is quantum wow when physical interaction is used information exchange why is it quantum becomes obvious the fundamental quantum quantum of information is one bit one unit of entropy that one system exchanges for another so one bit one quantum of information is the answer to one yes or no question that is quantum do you want to add anything here daniel this is the block text is from the paper and just one piece that will be interesting to explore is just how does time and temperature come together like i had just heard or thought more about the space required for storage and not really seen it as much connected to the speed of obtaining that yes or no answer at different temperatures and what that might mean for biological or for digital systems but i'm sure that's a very um [Music] foregone conclusion maybe working with a quantum device but new to me and jason was like oh yeah of course that's the case and they they talk a lot so foreshadowing they're gonna um you know really present this within like a facetime independent context which is kind of cool and then like link it back to time which that kind of gets a little interesting all right so moving on uh hilbert spaces um so daniel do you want to say a bunch about this or what do you want to say about this and then i'm going to highlight some stuff i'll just read what they um wrote oh here's the the red part is was our comments on what they wrote people can pause it to read what they wrote the hilbert spaces contain all states described as a vector and this is one way that qubits are constructed by relating two levels of a system like electrons in a ground or excited superposition and then the collapse into one or those other bands and so that's more of like a uncertainty to discrete transition but then in the limit of high temperature there's a lot of blur or experimental factors that can be modeled as blur that results in a smoother distribution of outcomes and [Music] here this hilbert space is describing how the experiment is set up and the information that's being modeled at a given time so the state of that this space consists of the options for is like the just the experiments space including the total target system and the observer maybe so i like this quote at the end that as fuchs put it infinite dimensional hilbert spaces are from an information perspective merely a useful artifice permitting computation with differential equations and they they contain all this possible states in an experiment as vectors so um there's more to read about that um and also the mathematical notation if you're curious about cats and bras and some of these brackets that we had to to dig through to find solid ground yeah okay so the principle of unitarity is the principle that observable information like energy is neither created nor destroyed by physical processes and i thought that this was interesting so time reversal symmetry is essential for the conservation of information so a system is time reversal symmetric if its equations of motion allow perfect prediction of the starting point based on knowing the state of the system at any given time so like if you know time whatever x time steps you can still say something about the starting system because you can run it forward and backward in time i mean there were some cool things like about if you pulled up a mirror that's that's like enables the time reversal so some things go forward but like the spin of an electron is spun backwards in time right so it's like those kinds of things um like our some things are parallel and some things are opposite in time reversal symmetry but um anyway i thought that was interesting and fundamental so kind of the principle of an eternity and also because we're going to talk about time in a cool way i think um okay so yeah unitary do you want to say about unitary daniel i said a little bit so let me pick out some things here that you want to talk about okay this was all with just jason helping us and again it's like an opportunity for anyone who's familiar with these to uh formalisms to help us a little bit more through but just to pick up on one point just as blue mentioned like we're doing experiments where it doesn't matter what time we started at in a sense like it may matter in the sense that the different times lead to different results but a statistical framework for observation that can cut through some of the parts of the experimental context that are not relevant to compare different events that happen a different time in a unified statistical framework and so that was what led to this principle of unitarity that the total probability distribution is preserved with like a mass of one so that there can be information evolution but it's happening in a certain space where there's a certain invariance that allows useful computation to happen cool oh yeah conservation of probability so that's something that maybe came up um like the probability that a particle is somewhere like it's somewhere there's a hundred percent probability that the particle is somewhere so it didn't disappear so that was another kind of interesting point we were talking um before this i mean that's kind of what how you get the conservation of observable information as well um okay separability and holographic encoding okay this one just to uh briefly look at a previous slide i think this was from 32 we were looking at sparsely coupled systems from a matrix perspective and so the dense coupling of like subunits one through six with each other was mainly like within the click of the red or the blue but then there's these off diagonals that reflect the sparse coupling of denser clicks and so in section 2.3 of this paper they're also talking about coupling patterns in systems specifically ones that have a separability so like one of those blocks could be the experimental system the quantum computer and the other one of the blocks could be the experimenter and then there could be sparse connectivity reflecting the experimental apparatus but that was being approached from a quantum holographic angle also setting up for a markov blanket take cool so one sentence on this page that i think is important is underlined here the entanglement entropy is a mutual information measure that detects quantum correlation or coherence between a and b um and so that defines separability and if either a system is separable or it's entangled so separable states are also called decoherent and entangled states are also called coherent so just just point out as we go forward and kind of dive a little bit deeper into the math it it's kind of like if it was parametric classical statistics we would say uncorrelated or correlated if it was information theory we'd say no information or yes it gives information bayesian graph yes it has causal influence or no it doesn't and then this is the quantum take yes it's entangled or no it's not entangled also don't forget conditional dependence or conditional independence so where where is it conditionally dependent um and we know that like the markov blanket can help to define conditional dependence um when we've looked at active inference in the past yeah um okay cool so where do you want to talk about the hamiltonian or not at all what do you want to say not at all okay so there's one cool thing that i want to point out here um you know we talked about like which interactions strong interaction different time frames and how these are going to vary as we go forward um but but here i really just wanted to point out that that this h of a b is like the hamiltonian so we're talking about matrices separability interacting matrices conditional dependence just on the last slide um and so the interaction between the hamiltonian of the matrix can be decomposed into this h a b where this is like the interaction between a and b so ajb can be looked at as we go forward as the energetic interaction between matrix a and matrix b state a state b position a position b or um they give it to us in a very generic form so i didn't really know how to apply that going forward but maybe if the authors were listening they'll come in and rescue us um that's the only thing i really wanted to point out from from that side and then this is kind of cool so this this equation six which we just looked at um which is the energetic interaction between a and b um this is physical interaction which i guess is that could be physical interaction between a and b that also be energy right matter equals nc squared physical interaction equals thermodynamics times yes or no questions so it's cool the authors say this formulation emphasizes what quantum theory is about the process of obtaining information obtaining information from b requires in particular that a acts on b by asking questions as wheeler puts it no question no answer all inference in this framework is active inference equation 6 does not allow passive perception to be a physical process super interesting agreed from a lot of angles it almost takes it to a level we haven't seen from just saying well perceptual inference even the generative type so not just the signal processing but even a predictive processing generative framework for perception that doesn't take action into account is incomplete hence the motivation for active inference and this is somehow escalating that into saying that all inference in this framework is active inference and i wonder if that's because like a frame is always needed some kind of generative model is always needed as a recognition model dual for any observation so if you're in the business of making observations you're in the business of generative model modification one way or another or you're not the kind of thing that does either of those but they might come into play in the minimal active entity or the thing that can be modeled as a minimal active entity and so there's a lot of interesting areas and i think it's also quite interesting with the natural language equation so how should we read that dot thermodynamics what yes no questions and then times or what does it mean yeah there's the category theory like that that dot operator i forgot how to read it so hopefully um it'll be rescued um but yeah i i read it at times because you know i'm old school so going back to that same equivalent i thought that this was important it involves no assumptions about space-time objects or motions it is strictly topological given separability it identifies a boundary fancy b between a and b at which the energy interaction physical interaction between a and b is defined so i guess that would be like a space well i guess it's not space it's not space it's not time it's a physical it's an energy interaction hiv um anyway yeah and this is the markov blanket fancy b holography connection which is that all the information that is making the sparse connectivity of a and b we're talking about systems that have like this screen slash blanket slash experimental apparatus fancy b and the properties of it for a system that might be making classical like measurements or maybe it's making quantum measurements so implicitly the prior work had been thinking about what was on the other side of that experimental apparatus from a classical or from a non-quantum perspective we'll see and this is taking it more into asking what kind of mathematics would be needed to look at it if it were a quantum system that were being investigated cool and i think that takes us into figure one so here daniel was foreshadowing doing a great job of the holographic screen so this is a holographic screen fancy b separating systems a and b with an interaction h a b given by equation six and so this says that this this screen can be realized by an ancillary array of non-interacting qubits that are alternately prepared by a and then measured by b uh qubits are depicted as the spheres here um and there's no requirement that a and b share preparation and measure measurement bases so these are uh quantum reading or quantum reference springs so this is like they share the ability to prepare or measure that would be like quantum reference frame and we're going to get into the quantum reference frames just here in a couple slides um i think with a pretty good example cool anything to add or do you want to like unpack it with the next couple slides um just thinking about this as like a quantum holograph is sort of the generalization maybe of thinking about this in the classical information what if this were the chat between blue and i so we could have different perspectives different reference frames different semantics but if we're not in the same chat room then we're not in the same chat room that's like the holographic screen or the observable that's getting passed between these two systems a and b and they don't have to be two people it could be like a person and some other system on the other side of the holograph slash information channel and the whole question is what kind of math describes that classical information channel case and how is that similar or different or compatible or whatever with thinking about it not as a information bit from a standard probability distribution but like a quantum information bit with a complex statistical distribution nice um so they describe the holographic screen actually um as they say the holographic screen fancy v has an obvious interpretation in the language of the free energy principle and active inference it implements the markov blanket that separates from b so we've seen the markov blanket before and you know mentioned it here but but i think that they are going to you know implement this holographic screen as this markov blanket um yeah perfect cool oh and then the quantum reference frame fun so uh here they say we show in particular that the fvp emerges naturally in any setting in which an agent or particle deploys quantum reference frames namely physical systems that give observational outcomes and operational semantics to identify and characterize the states of other systems in this environment and and so this was kind of a cool um figure that i that i pulled down so it's like a man on the train to the man the train is moving and to the person on the train the man is moving right and so it depends on your perspective and this is this is kind of what a quantum reference frame is getting at here so um this says quantum features such as quantum superposition are only defined relative to an observer when we look at the train from the point of view of an observer standing on the platform the train looks in a quantum superposition of different positions however an observer sitting on the train sees the observer on the platform and the ball in a quantum superposition so it's a cool illustration of just kind of how things look differently depending where you're standing okay this is awesome i like how you brought in the art and the images are a little subtly different but then in a way that really makes one think and the classical case would be what if both of them were moving or still and then they only got to get a frame update once every two seconds or once every five seconds so then there'd be like still an uncertainty distribution but it'd be a classical parametric statistics or information theory uncertainty about location and that's going to be the big question how is that variance estimation that we've already been exploring and that type of inference related to quantum information where there's something a little bit bigger and more complex or different than just simply low sampling rate leading to positional uncertainty of a massive train that's not subject to so-called quantum effects cool um did you want to what so this is kind of cool do you want to unpack this slide here daniel i'm just looking forward to what the free choice assumption means in setting but we just highlighted what is this all going to say about free choice this specific slide but also the broader discussion so i i agree too i think the free choice aspect is cool um here the authors say provided a and b are separable assuming that there are no super determinist a priori correlations um z a and z b what is the z i'm not sure what the z is oh choices of z so the z is the choice the choice of a and the choice of b are uncorrelated this is the free choice assumption free choice is often claimed to be essential to science as a practice if it characterizes any bounded system consistency with quantum theory and special relative relativity together requires that it must characterize all systems so free choice of a basis introduces quantum noise that is indistinguishable observationally from classical noise and and noise is going to become important here um as we move toward the end of the a and z so yeah anyway that's cool okay [Music] nice so here they talk about um the z-axis in figure one i should have pasted figure one in here um they say that the z axis is a reference frame free choice of the axis generalizes the free choice of the reference frame encoding each qubit on the holographic screen fancy beat right so um yeah and the part in red looking forward to unpacking a qrf cannot therefore be fully specified by any finite bit string it is non-fungible in the terminology of citation 40. it's the quantum active nft crossover that we all needed we have it but we need to explore it and find out what it means super cool um and they say that they consider a and b to be isolated during the time interval between preparation and measurement steps um and i think that we'll get into that um in a little bit more like preparation and measurements as we talk about time and memory and coding um yeah and that's what this um nine formalism is roughly describing something like that there's yes yeah what is happening with it so it says the idea of a computation um is this so you have uh bits that have one time step going to bits at another time step and then you have the um markov blanket in one time step going to another markup blanket at t plus one and then this is it za is that free choice that's in there oh no it's if so i'm not sure what that one is but yeah we can we can unpack that more i uh i will unpack some of the later math but um this i think it's just important to establish the quantum reference frame anyway yeah that's good cool okay um next where are we ah here we go see i'm gonna start to unpack some math now when i when i start to roll out the variables here we go okay so we will be interested in what follows in quantum systems considered to be observers that deploy one or more distinct quantum reference frames to measure particular subsets of the bits encoded on their boundaries slash markup blankets um and yes these will d effectively decompose the holographic green fancy b into disjoint sectors that we will label e for the observed environment f for the unobserved environment and y for the memory sector prospectively so um yeah we're gonna we're gonna break that out um i think yeah attention also so they really talk about the sectors as a sense right like so i have like my vision sector my hearing sector my taste sector right and so like i'm making observations of my environment with all these like my temperature sensing sector so there's all of these different ways um you know to observe the environment with different sectors so yeah cool it's kind of like saying you win some you lose some you don't play every game it's kind of like whatever space we're talking about here which happens to be this boundary that has all these interesting properties there's some that are being observed some that are being unobserved and a special sector that gives continuity of information in some way through time yeah um so this is cool here free choice of a decomposition of a holographic screen fancy b interceptors with different quantum reference frame induced semantics is indicative of agency so i like that and i'm curious to um unpack that maybe a little bit more something for to ask the authors about in the dot one yeah or also all non-trivial agents are cognitive systems that engage in active inference what is non-trivial who like how do we escape or how do we escape this infinite multi-perspective multi-scenario universe or do we just have a way of working with that i do think that they get into non-trivial here in a little while um but yeah they say a non-trivial agent is a system with internal dynamics that breaks the swap symmetry of its boundary markov blanket holographic screen however they're going to start to use these things interchangeably so i'm just going to keep saying holographic screen fancy b um but but i guess if your internal dynamics don't break the swap symmetry or right like if your internal dynamics are it are um trivial or like not relevant um or if you don't if they don't have an effect on the boundary maybe that's that becomes trivial yeah wondering if that's the mirror versus adaptive active inference boundary that we've discussed or what what this maps to where does this kick in or not so we'll explore it though it totally seems like it's definitely the mirror versus active inference that's how i interpreted it as i was reading it so it sounds like that to me oh and okay now we're gonna head into some 17 related information because they're going to turn this discussion from qrfs as reference frames to channel theory which is going to enable this context switching discussion that's important later so this is brought up in number 17 and 17.1 is where we had chris fields and uh great discussion there so continue blue cool um yeah so channel theory of quantum reference frames so i think we've said channel theory is an application of category theory to two spaces and i'm not gonna read the paper here but i'm going to go back to some of the slides that we used from 17 because i think that we kind of unraveled it there in a way that was maybe digestible more so than reading you know equations off of a paper um so this is the true space daniel what's a two space so k is a set a are objects x are attributes a two space fancy a over the set k is the relationship between the objects a and their attributes x i thought of it just like a computer function like in python or any language that's just taking in three kinds of data the set the objects and the attributes so describing a large variety of things but it's just kind of integrating those three types of data in a principled way and enabling transformations between different representations that might look very different or allow for different implementations but also commonly use like all of this information or even just a subset of the information because that just throws out information which you can always do i really like the python example so like if k is the python dictionary a are the keys and x are the values like you can describe the relationship between the keys and the values with a chew space like that is that what the shoe space does so like you could say you know your keys are apple orange banana and your values are red orange yellow and so then the two spaces how you describe that relationship color something like that cool okay so going into channel theory and how two spaces um work how channel theory works so it says in channel theory two transforms become isomorphisms which are natural maps between classifiers so classifiers link tokens to types that encompass them like for a stoplight a set of tokens would be red green and yellow so that is the set of tokens i think this just builds one level on what you described which is instead of just the data structure of just saying this is what the function is requesting or this is why it's being stored in memory this is like saying we're going to interpret some of these edges and relationships as classifier mappings or infomorphisms like information sharing or statistical dependencies or some other type of informational edge but on that space that we've been discussing yes so so they take it to um a diagrammatic level where at the center it's almost looks like a pyramid so there's a c um and this this core c is the information channel this is the infomorphism that allows semantic information and this i thought it was very cool that it's very different from shannon information it's not just bits it's like the meaning behind the bits um like you can say you know you can see the word um bank and are they talking about a riverbank um the bank that holds your money or like a bank shot in pool like there's some underlying i i would dare to say context that is important for not just the letters b a and k in that order so it's not just the tokens in the particular order but it's like the semantic context that allows transmission between classifiers so i look at this like a shared memory so like if we look at the classifier a1 here which would be stoplight the tokens are red green and yellow classifier a2 would be motorist actions the tokens would be stop go forward or i say proceed slowly but it's really get out of the intersection right like that's what yellow means um and then there's other classifier types could be like pedestrian actions child's game actions like when you're playing red like green light do you run do you stop like freeze um so or do you walk right so there's all these different um classifiers that can then map via a core information channel c shared memory semantic information between those classifiers cool okay so going on they build from this pyramid they invert the pyramid um to form this cone cocoon diagram so they say that a commuting finite cone diagram is made of a cone which is the upright pyramid and a cocoon which is the inverted pyramid on a finite set of classifiers um it illustrates commutativity so specifically these operators g12 g23 like you can go all the way out to the set like there's a commutativity or like a um superimposability commutativity between with a shared infomorphism if that makes sense it also captures this more subtle duality between processes um it enables object files tokens and histories to be viewed not as tokens but as types that organize um respectively trajectory components features and feature-based singular categories and and make them mutually consistent collections so like where you have all of those um classifiers they are they're consistent across the board so you can use them to map and unmap right if i can just give a take on this so g12 is saying that there's a relationship between a1 and a2 it could be like appending by one row or maybe changing one little bit through time or having some ability to translate like a state machine or something like that let's just say that there's some relationship and then there's also these f functions that allow the a's to be part of a shared context like the pedestrian scene that makes sense and then that is shaped like a cone and then that is kind of like sense making that semantics is making sense and then this cocon or the diamond shape is where there's c and d who are both like cognitive sense making frames and then now they're having a shared holograph a or shared access and then it's that is a different object with a different geometry yeah that would be like i'm looking at the same set of classifiers that you're looking at and we both see we both know what they mean we both know that red means stop and um greedy means go semantically exactly right right or red could mean apple depending on depending on where you're going with that right so it could be it could be an inside joke yeah um okay cool so there's the cone cocoon hopefully that was um unpacked with some level of uh intelligibility so now we can move into figure two where they attach this cone cone diagram to measurement operators any set of measurement operators that are used to measure the um states on the boundary that defines the relationship between a and b this hiv between system a and system b [Music] were the scientists we cared about r context c we're system a we're making measurements from our perspective of a screen and we're setting the context of interpreting those observations in this situation totally um i could definitely be standing on the other side of that holographic screen making my measurements from d from the inverted from the upside down pyramid but they would be left and right pointing measuring onto the same screen if i was system b and you were system a in that kind of context cool anything else to add no awesome okay um so this is just some more i think this slide talking about the cone cone diagram but but something that's to point out that there's the dual construction that is when it commutes i think i did say that already so when the infomorphisms on the same classifiers where all the arrows are reversed when it's reversible then that's a commuting cone cone diagram so non-community is the opposite of that right so we're going to talk about non-commutativity as we go forward and here what's one thing that i think is happening hopefully is like we have been discussing this in the context of two different observers having the same semantics from the same screen c and d and then they say if c equals d or c prime equals d prime then you can sort of draw another consistent world and this is sort of like a recognition semantics and then the outcome is like an operational or generative semantics in a different way because it's like generating the observations or something like that but there's going to be like a duel between the diamond and the hourglass nice cool okay um all right here we go more of this um commutativity so so here they talk about commutativity as bayesian coherence now we talked a little bit about quantum coherence earlier but there's this they're bringing this notion of bayesian coherence up so viewing commutativity and bayesian coherence as fundamental to the definition of measurement like if i measure the length of the salamander and daniel measures the length of the cylinder salamander there there we could get the same answer or not um so and hence also to the definition of preparation or action on the environment so this suggests this born rule which is that's what you blew up daniel don't know what it is let's learn about it yeah okay yeah that was that one's um right let's learn that let's let's let the authors unpack that one for us yeah oh yeah that's the rule so here blow it up again for me oh i'll blow it up actually myself so yeah too far so they say the probability of obtaining x to state x is the sum of observations over states is that observations in the states i should have defined these then the probability of obtaining a measurement is it a measurement as an observational outcome uh in the description for coherently assigning amplitudes to components okay so anyway we can let the authors unpack that one for us i can't do it all right repeated measurements and system identification so this is section three moving on we develop in section 3 a generic formal description of how one quantum system identifies another quantum system as a persistent entity a thing so here they're going to talk about thingness and measures records and compares its states by deploying deploying specific sequences of quantum reference frames and so like how do i know that daniel is a different thing than me right um yeah that's cool sometimes i think we're the same thing because we're doing the same thing at the same time is there a thing is there a group thing that's a group thing our consensus we're having a thing at my house that's it all right um so they break this section so these sections get really awesome so memory time and course grading the idea that a system must possess a quasi-non-equilibrium steady state solution to its density dynamics and hence be restricted to trajectories in its classical configuration space that do not diverge exponentially over time in order to be observable as a thing immediately raises the issues of time as the measurable duration and of memory as persistent over measurable time and so that they show in this figure that the agent a can only detect changes in the nest density and employ them as bases for inference if actions and actions if a can write time ordered records to subsequently read from the memory sector y so here the memory sector is y um the environment is e and this g i j here i think it's better done in the next one oh yeah perfect we have the next screen right here yep um so eij is this um a time clock a time step from one memory that's the dynamics of internal time internal clock that's what it is of the agent um we talked already about the different parts of the screen and how some are being observed some are unobserved and then there's the memory sector and here like the um unobserved environment is the biggest set i think it's like mostly at least in this image and so one question is just what does this represent in terms of our computers or our sensory apparatus and how is it related to some of the work that they like cited and some related work about attention and bayesian graphs this is a cool representation also like notice that your observations are different and not overlapping with from your memory like if your old memory the new information isn't coming in if you're not paying attention to anything it can't have an effect like that type of thing right and so this is an illustration of quantum reference frames required to write a readable memory of an observed environmental state e so e and y read the state from e and write it to y respectively and the clock is a time quantum reference frame that defines the time coordinate a so at the time step you read the environment and then you write it to memory y cool little perception action loop with memory yeah okay four yep in a loop sorry cool awesome the figure four um it's a memory read write cycle defining one tick from i to j of the environment so here it's like you read from the environment measure or read measure and then write prepare so like you prepare for the next time step all quantum reference frames and the comparison functions are implemented by the quantum dynamics ta which is the big block arrow so if this were like an eeg headset that was measuring at 100 hertz 100 times per second that would be like 100 classical information reads per second and then you could do signal processing i think this is kind of like the time step is the sampling frequency of the experimental apparatus that's defined by this partitioning of the blanket fancy b holograph and then sub sectors with these different interpretations of being like observed unobserved or memory components and and the authors say here they say formally we think of this pa as the weighted sum of all possible paths from the boundary boundaries from the boundary the fancy b at one state to the boundary the fancy b at the next state so that is the internal dynamics are how the holographic screen is shifted from t to t plus one and also this is where there's the cone so the the b are like those that line of a's that are all lined up and then now it's bottlenecking this is the hourglass and then going back out yes yes should superimpose those um figures for next time yep um yeah all right then memory time and course grading so the internal dynamics that operate on those states to maintain a non-equilibrium steady state density are spatially localized inside of the boundary and the boundary represents a hilbert space where we talked earlier um and it's not a physical space-time decomposition so the boundary b is all those little spheres still what is memory we'll discuss it yeah and importantly they say figure four illustrates an important distinguishing distinction between classical and quantum representations of dynamics um classical physics assumes a space time in betting and the quantum does not interesting yeah i'm curious about the self evidencing that they mention here also i'll have to ask them about that okay okay cool learning and generative models i'll let you take this one away um this kind of took us almost briefly out of the quantum but just to give an example of a simpler thing that this is like an elaboration or a generalization of a bayesian approach like calm and filtering which is just taking it's like a dragging an estimate through time as new information comes in and so that's what's happening in a sense here with formalism 27 there's a prior and a posterior and that's moving forward so it's kind of like using this dragging filter through time if that were classical information and then there's something different happening with quantum and that's that that piece that we're gonna keep on returning to but this is like a bayesian analog and now the math is being used to describe these quantum systems yes okay moving on section 3.3 identifying and measuring systems embedded in e so we've so far considered only observers a that measure the states of their observed environments e without decomposing e into systems that have their own specific states and the question of how an observer distinguishes a system from the environment in which s is embedded is central to classical cybernetics so i think that that's um important like are the other agents do they matter are they just part of the environment like there's always that um question of of you know is is it its own thing that other person over there or it's just my perception of my environment and the second part there is like it's um that sort of entity niche differentiation or delineation and then under the rubric of object persistence the conceptuality of thickness to cognitive and developmental psychology so that's like children with peek-a-boo and so it's like what connects the child playing peek-a-boo to the cybernetic entity differentiating causes and how does quantum with its observer based relationality connect those areas so here they use a special delineation for an environment that indicates the remainder of e when other systems in the environment are removed and the question of how an observer distinguishes an external system from its surrounding environment prior to and as a precondition for measuring some state of interest is um not something that people traditionally address because it is thermodynamically and computationally difficult demanding special requirements on the observers cool all right so figure 5 shows us the system i think it just shows us like pretty much where we are systems s you know here you have a and b identifying requires identifying some proper component r that maintains a constant state or a density of time average samples as the pointer state of pi right so you need a pointer to point to the system um or density of time average samples of interest varies oh so like as this goes to attention right so what is your what are you pointing to oh another way i was kind of seeing this one was um this the it's like a clock hand so this could be like a time scenario or it could be quantum with like the spin or with the angle in a complex field or something like that but you can decompose the total system s into the time invariant part which is like your python data structure and that's like saying here's the the structure of the variables and then just like the variables themselves that are time variant which is like the clock hands so they'll be like the body of the clock that's time invariant and then there's the parts that are time varying i don't know how that r and p and s partitioning connects back but that's what this kind of looks like yeah i'm also kind of unsure about the pointer states and but i think it's the interest varies right so um yeah which i think i think that points to attention like as your interest as your point of focus shifts like what are you pointing to because like as you look here in one direction there's a set of variables that are there in that direction like this wall that corner this refrigerator or whatever and then as you shift here your interest or attention is shifting to a new set of variables but you still know that that other set of variables is there that goes to the object permanence that we were just talking about before so like i know that refrigerator was in my first point of view but it's not in my second point of view but i know that it's still there um that that to me kind of is how how i think about this the pointer uh it'll be for the authors to maybe unpack this one a little bit more for us um oh okay we did talk about the markov colonel versus the marco blanket daniel you you so eloquently explain it to me just one possibility is the blanket is the set of states that insulate the internal and the external making them conditionally independent and then the markov kernel could be like that applied through time and it's kind of like a arima model you could have like a temporal depth of an auto regression and then the temporal depth of the markov kernel through time would be like what time steps are able to carry forward but let's discuss that with people who know better yes cool okay good um all right so non-commutativity uh context switching so we talked about non-commutativity we talked about what commutativity means and so non-commutativity would be the opposite of that um so here they say as emphasized by bohr 100 years ago a finite quantum of action partitions the set of all possible quantum measurement operators into a set of complementary non-commuting pairs the most well-known being position and momentum so if you're trying to measure the position of a particle you can't simultaneously measure the momentum of the particle at the same time so that's non-commutativity yes and so why does context switching matter they say an observable an observer a capable of switching between non-commuting quantum reference frames must to maintain an operable memory implement a clock that is invariant under basis rotations on the energy between a and b or the physical interaction between a and b if measurements made at clock ticks i and j do not commute however the corresponding clock operations will not commute um so non-commutativity forces ta which is time or the time step that it takes to record a memory to be unidirectional and hence memory records to be encoded irreversibly with an accompanying expenditure so the internal clock thus defines ta as entropic time i thought that was super interesting so it's not like actual time but it's like time that you paid entropy for like time that entropy was expended for i'm on the clock time requiring work right or something to that end all right uh cool so context switching between non-commuting quantum reference frames like position and momentum while holding the other quantum reference frame constant so that's the one that's constant is here the one that's ref in this figure 34 or equation what is this thing it's a diagram that's what it is so in this diagram number 34 um these different pointer sectors u and v could be like the different um non-computing and then you have overlapping but mutually communicating operators in a canonical canonical context switch so that's like someone could be standing not at the train platform or on the train and be observing both of those people i suppose different frame a bigger a bigger context they each have their own local coherence but it's interoperable so it's part of a bigger umbrella which is like the big c at the top cool okay okay good so that's diagram 34. if it fails to commute then the observables are non-co-deployable so that's like position and momentum those are non-co-deployable observables so non-commutativity in the in diagram 34 has been specified in terms of non-existence of a consistently definable joint probability distribution of conditionals so that's like the conditional independence right this non-co-deployable co-deployability of observables amounts to the occurrence of intrinsic quantum contextuality in relationship to that diagram so this goes really back it speaks a lot to what um chris talked to us about when we did number 17. so let's get notes on this stuff yeah for sure um so they say in 4.2 below that context switching increases variational free energy by generating prediction errors um and like if you're in one context and you have a prediction and then you move to another context with the same prediction your outcome's going to be different so it increases very variational free energy which makes minimizing very variational free energy and complying with the fvp more difficult so like going from my same generative model from one context to another context to another context makes it hard but can lead to radically better generative models so you're always updating your gen your model becomes more generalizable generalizable under different contexts so yes quant context switching poses a fundamental challenge to any classical formulation of the fep and a fundamental explanation i've not heard that before for quantum formulation um i wonder if this provides like some evidence for us having a shared reality and i i've um brought that up a couple different times too here cool it's the fact thing or expression which is to be explained or explicated nice okay now let's get to the paper what do you think blue we're finally here um we made it this is the best part uh yeah the fvp for generic quantum systems so all that background was to lead you here to the um to this place where we are now so how the fep emerges in this setting um and we're gonna look at its asymptotic behavior um considering how it addresses the fundamental problem that's posed by quantum context switches all right we're getting there all right you want to take this one we're going to go into more detail so that we can get a lot more in to this dot zero but we've seen the variational free energy in the context of perceptual inference where there's a surprisal and a divergence term that gets bounded so this is kind of like the snapshot question given the incoming sensory observations how should i update my generative model it's learning it's like a perceptual common filter yes it doesn't have action involved nice um they have this formulation of prediction error and they this is actually from um section 3.2 it's a representation of the prediction error of system a or agent a so this e-r-e-k so k we'll just let's go through these black ones first so k is the internal time clock so agent a's internal time clock ta it counts it it ticks it up so fancy b is the holographic screen pb is the dynamics of the interaction partner b and then this m sub e with respect to k is the observable behavior of the holographic screen fancy b localized to the sector e up to time t a equals k so like up to up leading up into this point um so is the observed environment just to connect it to the previous formalism e is the observed environment that is it so here this m a e this is the agent a's generative model of the action of the undo un known dynamics pb with respect to time i think oh yeah on the markup or the markup boundary holographic screen fancy b in sector e the environment that we looked at which is kind of like saying you only need to have a generative model on where you're expecting to find observations if you're going to measure just the thermometer you make a generative model with just a thermometer and that's how you get the cone cocon diamond hourglass that isn't like with extraneous or redundant or incompatible elements so here this um equation prediction error it's like er sub parenthesis k um this is the agent's agent a's total reducible uncertainty about agent or system b at time t a equals k so so this is like the uncertainty about another system within the environment that's why the system separation that we saw in figure 5 was important so if we're going to define us we're going to look at how other systems interact on the holographic screen and then we're going to think about what can we predict what that system is doing or not like the environment's not doing anything because it's just sitting there it's the environment but that's at any given time step snapshot um so it is therefore an upper bound on the surprise um reprisal analogy to f of pi that we just looked at earlier that daniel mentioned the upper bound on surprise cool okay here we go getting into how the quantum does the fvp all right so a generic quantum system a will act so as to minimize er sub x for each deployable quantum reference frame x so a system a has different deployable quantum reference frames that's analogous to a sense i have hearing vision taste smell temperature sensing etc many different deployable quantum reference frames and i will minimize my total reducible uncertainty at each time step for each quantum reference frame yes still there cool okay so a trivial agent can be viewed as executing a trivial quantum reference frame as only exercising choice of basis for writing to and reading from the holographic screen fancy b as a whole and so satisfies the fep trivially okay let's have a let's have a round table on what that means we should do it yeah four point two that's it or forty point one we'll be there's equation forty nice there it is all right so the authors say uncertainty and prediction error and hence variational free energy is generated in the current formalism by system a's in principle ignorance of both the state of b and the dynamics p of b of its interaction partner b as the bits a reads from the boundary fancy b are written by p b this is like the the agent or system b is writing to the boundary so a's ability to predict the future states of its observable sectors and hence to minimize that er sub x for each quantum reference frame x through equation 40 which we just looked at and we're going to look at it again depends on its ability to predict the behavior of pb locally on each observable sector so i have to be able to predict how daniel's going to smell how he's going to look so so my ability if i'm looking at my other agents in the environment over each what temperature he's going to be is he going to have cold hands or cold feet or something like that but my ability to minimize my variational free energy over another system in the environment depends on my ability to predict their behavior writing to the environment on all of those quantum reference sectors good enough good enough okay an animal for example must employ its available senses hence its observable sectors to predict the nutritional value of food okay here we go so this is where i got it gets a little fuzzy for me so uh i was good up until this point um they say the weak interaction limit that allows separability between a and b is significant so h a b which is the physical interaction between a and b and hence the boundary the holographic screen between a and b must have significantly lower dimension than the physical location of b and hence the observable dynamics of b if the weak interaction limit is to hold um my brain is melting now all the way down so yeah anyway what do you think do you have any thoughts on that um not sure if it means that the sparse coupling has to be sufficiently sparse it has to be a lot lower dimension than the system otherwise it's um not appropriately bottlenecked so there's a lower dimensional interface that's like sparse coupling it's physical interaction in the h frame and it's the holograph slash markov blanket with the fancy b but if the interaction is with the h and that's kind of what we'll discuss like are we talking about physical interactions of quantum systems or we're talking about any mechanistic interaction between any mechanistic system or are we talking about statistical edges statistical interactions like an interaction term between two different systems um and so just what i've written down here kind of paraphrases what they said uh up there so the ability for a system a to predict the dynamics of system b depends on the dynamic complexity of the interaction between system b um which is pb on the holographic screen so what is b writing to the holographic screen like what is my refrigerator writing to the holographic screen um i would say that's a trivial system right it's like outputting a little bit of heat it keeps my food a little bit cold most of the time so i can with pretty good reliability predict the dynamics of my refrigerator i have less ability to predict the dynamics of daniel or my children who are like total agents of chaos right so but but like i want to minimize my uncertainty i'm pretty certain about what my refrigerator is doing i don't know what my kids are doing when i leave the room um yeah so that that kind of made sense to me but the schrodinger's cat to blue's children pipeline we just got there um anything else to out here dana no let's moving forward okay so here is a little diagram of what it looks like for me to predict the dynamics of my refrigerator so so this is figure 6 a um it says the trivial agent in figure 6 a look like a noise source to a so yes my refrigerator is a source of noise it just like it actually literally makes noise um and you know puts out a little bit of heat so it says emission of hawking radiation from a black hole provides perhaps the most pure example of such a noise source while the dimension inside the black hole can be arbitrarily large the internal dynamics are uncoupled from the classical information encoded on the horizon and hence have no classical computational power yes okay maybe refrigerator has more computational power than a black hole i don't know okay okay we move on here we go forward so the more interesting parts of a's option space for prediction are shown in panel b c and d where b is non-trivial if b is non-trivial it deploys at least one quantum reference frame x of b like so that's sector x of b acting on sector x b uh as discussed in section 2.5 b sectors must be mutually decoherent so the action of the dynamics on the sector of b is independent of action elsewhere is this independence that makes prediction possible if x of b does not overlap any sector um for a b will appear trivial so like if the green cone is totally removed from what the red cone is like it's a trivial thing like if you know my kids aren't here right now they're not immediately acting on my environment um so they're trivial i guess or this made me think about like if if someone was speaking a language that you didn't understand semantically not even in the queues and in the metadata like there's kind of speaking past each other even though you're sharing a screen but that's like an intentional informational interpretation and this is in a quantum interpretation about the shared semantic frame ranging from identical to overlapping to disjoint so in in a disjoint um way i'm trying to think of what else would be there so like a different language is good but like what about something like radiation emission right like so something's emitting radiation but i can't perceive that radiation so like the thing emitting radiation doesn't appear like it's impacting my environment at all so maybe something like that and i'd like maybe unobserved the part of of be the holograph that's not in the observed or memory sector yeah like that um okay cool so the interesting cases are the ones in which a and b's observable sectors overlap in this case intuitively in which a and b can see each other and hence interact in the ordinary non-technical sense of that term in panel b sector xb fully contains xa um yeah okay so let's go here let's look at the at the whole figure now so we saw all the ones trivial and non-trivial okay so a is a trivial agent so they're not putting out any um b encodes a sector that contains xa but is bigger so i like to think about this as like um a teacher so we're going to get into like teaching and learning so this is like a teacher that knows more than the student can pick up maybe um in that kind of way so the bits on xb but outside xa encode non-local hidden variables for a and then in diagram c the sectors of x a and x b overlap the areas of non-overlap become noise sources so here it's like um you know i can understand you when you speak english but not when you speak chinese so like when you're speaking chinese we have this non-overlapping frame anyway how do you think of that dan um this is just speculative but um in the case of b so we're the observer investigator a so in the case of of frame b there's so much information like in the linear regression data set by quantum that there's basically anywhere we look we can totally get all the information so it looks like there's non-local hidden variables because it's like super determined in the case of c the regression has like an r squared of 0.5 or something or 0.6 and so some of it lines up semantically but if we of course had the perfect attention or the perfect observation we would be able to make a better regression but then like i'm just trying to take the linear regression normal information framework and then that's where having people familiar with quantum will be really helpful and i hope they find this discussion and upcoming 1.1.2 as like just the introduction of hopefully some bi-directional exchange because this may be something where active inference is complementary isomorphic incompatible like let's not lose touch with the active inference thread and then also how is this relating to quantum and that's how we're going to get up in that quadrant where they both are yeah so in d where the um sector of x is equal to the sector of or sorry the sector x of a is equal to the sector x of b um so that means that the quantum reference frame is identical it's an identical frame like we're we are sharing a quantum reference we're both standing on the platform or we're both on the train um and so that sector a is equal to sector b any variational free energy there between a and b is generated by insufficient learning it's not like we both can't see the train or we both can't see the platform because we're in the same place but um so there's somebody there is doing some insufficient learning if this is the case then you just simply need to sample more but you already have the right scope and you're not at risk of over sampling but it's a little bit more quantum cool and that brings us to this beautiful formulation in equation 41. variational free energy equals noise plus insufficient learning so noise is capturing that bottom left part that we just discussed and insufficient is capturing the d case and so if it was uh more and more overlapping then you want more and more sampling but less and less overlapping is going to require less and less learning or learning will be less and less helpful so how is this compatible incompatible with the actin framings that we've seen for vfe and efe and then how is this compatible or similar to some of the formalisms and the framings that are really familiar to statisticians into quantum information scientists [Music] and i would also like to like know what teachers think so if you're a teacher and you're watching this like like what what is your take on that do you minimize free energy by minimizing noise and you know maximizing learning or or yeah like that okay um cool so asymptotic behavior of the fvp so we have these two formulations surprise loan divergence which we've seen before in a similar way many times and then noise plus insufficient learning so now we want to say how is it minimized how does an agent act in accordance with the fep what do you want to add here yeah just they wrote comparing equations 35 and 41 it becomes clear what this amounts to a system self evidence is by behaving in a way that minimizes noise while improving learning and so here they're juxtaposing the f of pi on surprisal and divergence decomposition of variational free energy with this noise plus insufficient learning framing so we'll have time to unpack that and hopefully connect it to some systems but it's just a very interesting way that they've reached this trade-off learning requires seeking it's like how do we get there well that goes back to the um to the context switching like if you're always in the same context like if you're always you know listening to the same music you're never gonna learn any new music that someone else might know like or or so you have to kind of change um change your context maybe take someone else's perspective but you know seeking what but we'll get there yes okay so let's also save this let's save this for one but the asymptotic behavior of the fep let's just say why does it matter why are we studying asymptotic systems what is happening with the fpp asymptotically asymptotically meaning what but i think that that's a large discussion about entanglement and where everything is going and how it relates to the principle of unitarity yes okay cool just we'll get there in dot one unitary there's only one more sliders is the how yeah the fep drives um it is it becomes the principle of unitarity so we can we can discuss that in dot ones better how does it does it why does it matter why would it matter cool um okay discussion travis home please okay we're just gonna we're not gonna discuss any of the discussion here we're going to look at the summary of the results as they give it and then we're going to have a bunch of slides that will just be like a topic and then with the dot one and the dot two we're just gonna go to that topic and probably start with just reading a quote from that paragraph or hearing the authors or the participant's perspective on like each of those topics cool okay do you want to you can go for the summary come on help me out okay you you read the three just the three um big texts at the very beginning but the first summary of the results that the um authors say is that they can formulate this agent or information gathering and using system not just within the classical information theory context that we've been talking about informational and strategic agents but in the context of quantum information theory point two is not just using a generic agent or information gathering using system but specifically connecting the fep to its quantum theoretic formulation for generic quantum systems insert all the asterisks and other symbols about what that really means and about how active inference plays in etc and then three the part that we didn't really go into in this discussion when formulated as a generic principle of quantum information theory the fep is asymptotically equivalent to the principle of unitarity and under asked in the chat asymptotically in what parameter just exactly to what ends in what parameter so that's the summary of the results but the authors then embark on an awesome series of kind of like standalone paragraph vignettes related to a wide set of other ideas so for each of these ideas i'll um ask the question on the top and then if you want to give a thought on that topic or not okay so the first topic is yeah let me answer the question so it says actually asymptotically perfect learning so that's the asymptotically perfect finding that drives to unitary on one axis so anyway okay um what is observation that's deep several paragraphs they wrote about that and this quote um the idea of a metaphysically solipsistic or solipsist theory of observation is self-contradictory what but we'll discuss okay what is an agent and again we'll keep in mind classical physics classical fep non-classical fep that where are we bigger from earlier i'll copy that one back in because this is definitely like a where are we like what are the similarities and differences in the agent model for fep and not and for quantum and not any thoughts or like things that you'll want to ask about this what is free choice i think that's that was cool um yeah and like do you get degrees of freedom or free choice over cognitive parameters action parameters which one do you want choice over or all of them preferences okay what is self-evidencing so we've talked in several other discussions about classical or bayesian inference as self-evidencing like finding oneself in likely states expected in preferred states how is that different in active than other physics that's like going from the bottom left to the bottom right and then how is this different within active inference with this quantum integration and boost yes okay what of asymptotic behavior yeah um so i think here it's the asymptotically perfect learning like what is a gauge theoretic perspective i don't even want to open that kind of worms at all so yeah also this is like the quantum formulation the quantum formalism is background free space is simply an observable represented by a qrf that a system may or may not deploy it can therefore play no on-tech role in maintaining distinctions between systems this reflects the general role of physical 3d space in quantum field theories space is there to enforce separability c68 for general discussion from a gauge theoretical perspective so like the space between is what i'm gonna also um copy in a comment that underwrote in the live chat just anyone who asks questions um you know just put it in live chat or put as a comment under the video or email us but it helps us and it's awesome questions that people ask okay we will definitely look at this before we do that one and so if you you're welcome to join us get in touch if you want to participate live but also like we will ask these questions if we leave them in the chat yeah okay let's go to close out almost kind of getting there applications to biological cognition um and then they wrote in this paper in addition to the results listed above the current framework so the paper we've been discussing has a variety of more specifically biological consequences some of which have been discussed already in citation 13. and here's citation 13 fields glaze broke 11 minimal physicalism as a scale-free substrate for cognition and consciousness and here's the sections of that paper and so it's just kind of cool to connect back to the basal cognition computational boundaries of a self discussion that we've been having live stream number 39 just today um and we also have uh neurons as hierarchies of quantum reference frames which i haven't read yet um that this was just published in january of 22. i think that was co-released with this paper so i'm i'm excited to read that work also awesome so yeah what are the biological implications okay um quantum frames for foraging so unique explanations and predictions it predicts for example that moving in ordinary 3d space does not require a qrf for euclidean space and hence does not require an experience of space so like the fish could swim without knowing 3d and then from a classical perspective okay so i guess that means non-fep and or non-quantum this is certainly true evidence by place and grid cells in mammalian brains etc and then what happens when we integrate fep in the classical well the course graining would then be mandated by et cetera et cetera we'll explore okay then what happens if we go from classical to classical fep and then now go from fep to quantum fep still thinking about like foraging or information seeking and processing okay contextuality we talked about that a lot in 171 but just what is context environment surrounding is this what people mean when they say set the context for the dinner party or give context for a video that they sent what is that everyday sense of context and what is this sense of context okay next steps so these are the last two lines of the paper and they wrote in closing we hope that we have shown to readers familiar with the fep and active inference framework that quantum effects are worth considering both theoretically and in experimental design for readers not familiar with the classical fa ep but literate in quantum theory or vice versa we hope this paper has gone some way to contextualizing your qrfs incense making via markov blankets and their underlying holographic screens so this is like saying if you were familiar with either quantum not fep upper left or classical fep bottom right or maybe bottom left neither then this paper hopefully brought you towards that upper right corner of quantum fep and just like the classical classical way to end an fep paper was like we expect and prefer that this reduces your uncertainty this is like the classical quantum way to end the paper by saying we hope it's contextualized your qrf the clever ending to a very complex paper and it was really fun to work on this for a couple weeks leading up to these discussions and what else would you say as we now head into the dot one and two yeah so like thanks for putting up with our rough interpretation of this paper and we hope we didn't butcher it too badly yeah um we tried yeah if if you know more or would like to contribute to helping others know more about these topics that's what we're working on all the time in actin flap so if you've made it this far and you're riled up or curious about something then get in touch and let's try to make all of this more handleable and able to be translated and learned and applied yeah let's try to align our quantum reference frames with respect to actin what else can we say all right so see you all um soon thanks a lot blue thanks also jason and thanks everybody who will participate in the upcoming ones too so see you later bye you
