all right hello and welcome it's 9th of March 2025 we're in active inference guest stream 99.1 with avel so welcome AEL if you would like to say hello and go into your presentation we're looking forward to it so go for it hello so i a I work with Andy Clark who is a cognitive philosopher at the University of susex in the context of the Escape project which is a project on archaeology um cognitive archaeology uh and which focuses on the relation between mind and material culture I'm also a fing member of Kyo scientific par academic organization let's think of it as a think T and what I will uh present today let us consider it as um an advertisement for the social science sub project in the ACT Institute because it's the aggregation of the work I did to motivate well necessity for I will say new mathematics for the study of social change that are inspired by act inference but you know much on line with what is done mathematically to formalize it so we will go from contextuality to S constraints and I will try to articulate an active influence onology for participatory realism and social change so uh first let us try to motivate what is it that we are doing here so human minds and human culture display a very clear sign of openend evolution what do I mean by openend Evolution it is evolution that is open-ended I'm sorry this is kind of circular but essentially you can make new things that did not exist before before that were not a thing before that were not a part of some platonic space of things we made it up it was made up this is what I mean by open ended Evolution and this is true in generally whatever it is that you man do so for example we have an impression ofan escape on the left of the screen and you know it's buildings we made them up we built those buildings and they answered a specific perception of what building is that did not predate the concept of building the invention of building by humans and this is very manifest for example in writing because you know writing is this sign the interactivity of writing rely on signs being a thing that signs are a thing only if we look at them as science so we are looking at letters on the screen and understand them as being embedded with meaning but the concept of a c does not pre-exist Humanity there is no uh C dimension in the irational way function at Big Bang we made it up it's in evolution and the problem of uh explaining presenting addressing mathematically and physically the opended evolution of stuff it's a pretty huge problem uh St kofman best physics guy in my opinion is Carrier to that and let's be frank it not solid it is not near to solving it uh because it's a hard problem because there is this idea that open-ended change brings out new stuff and in mathematics we have to represent an nice space that has specific possibilities in it else who are not going far and this seems to be incoherent with the logic of pen Devolution so hard problem um I will jump to cognitive science because again my interest here in is in human mind and social Evolution and I will try to explain what we mean by explaining in cognitive science so for schematic purposes I will say there are three kinds of explanation that we can go for one is nomological it's with regard to laws so for example if I I don't know thr thing and see that it falls this way I can from nature law that describes what happens and because it happens a lot happens every time I try I claim it is a la I claim that describing the regularity explains this activity so it's a phenomological approach to explanation I just describe the phenomenal and hope this is explanatory this is how we do think in physics not in Psychology not in biology not in cognitive science not in sociology what is more natural in those discipline the special Sciences is a mechanical explanation so we look at structure and we show how the structure entail this in this phenomenon for example we have the out model of you know Neal activity which postulates a bunch of electrochemistry which if verified and it seems to be verified explains the action potential activity of neurons and I would say pretty close to Mechanical explanation in the space of POS explanation are functional explanation which address not how does it work but why is it and that is centered on you know functional hypothesis so it's for example most of what biologist evolutionary biologist do it's hypothesis what why must this happen because it's selected for and I would say both you can cluster those approaches between neological where you tend to try to describe laws and mechanical and functional hesis where we have a more lean approach to modeling and trying to get into what is going on in a specific system uh for it to act like that and in neuros science uh we are pretty good at mechanisms this is according to BU and Pini the HM Mark of what they call cognitive neuros sense we assume that the behavior as we can meure it derives from cognitive mechanisms those cognitive mechanisms are mented by the physical structure of the brain and this physical structure it's integrated in a context of operation that involves both physical physiological and eological factors so we can look at for example activation patterns activation in brain activity and map them into equation here it's from doob and it tries to map brain activity onto reinforcement learning which is U very uh hype family was at least a very hype family of algorithm describing learning so we can explain activity from structure but what we cannot do with a mechanistic approach is explain why the structure is there because you can describe you can explain activity from structure but if you try to explain structure from structure you get you know rtion to infinite you do not explain much much or at least you do not have the possibility to explain without regressing to the infinite the argument I will make here is that both cognitive structure understood as you know pattern in cognitive activity and its Evolution flow from a single phenomena which is the construction of meaning to cognitive agency so the structure produce a function a part of activity which itself will shade the structure at time t+ one this is the only way I can think of to you know at least have a baseline concept of what it is to study op Evolution system does stuff stuff changes system pretty simple I don't see how we could you know go around that and to be more precise I will argue that we exist in a context that is characterized by social constraints and that Define what we agree let us say we can and cannot do in a given CC text and these constraints are integrated and elected by humans and the way they are integrated and connected kind of ontologically by construction leads to their reconstruction and this is what anies both the structure of cognition through the integration of thinking in those system of constraints and the openend evolution thereof so we do active inference this is the active INF Institute we may as well explain active inference so I guess most people who are attending to the talk no know what I'm talking about but this is going on YouTube I will reference it I need to explain what active inference is active inference is uh built from what K Fone and colleagues proposed as a principle for cognition that is bed b inference inference is basically reduces to the formula you see on screen the probability of an hypothesis given evidence is equal to the probability of an Evidence given hypothesis time probity of the hesis over probility of evidence so for example if you hear barking it's pretty likely there is a dog unless uh it's very likely there is a dog near you uh uh for example you are in an office and the office is closed so there no dog can enter or unless you have other explanation for hearing barkings for example you have a YouTube tab open with eight hours of barking noises I don't know why you would but if you did you would hear barking and nothing of so this reduces to this formula uh P of e knowing h means the probability of hearing barking if there is a dog probability of h means probability of having a dog with you probability of e means probability of hearing the barking and you can compute the probability of having a dog with you knowing that you heard barking from that this is most basic stuff you can do in statistics and uh the thing is there is no reason why your brain or any single natural system for that matter could represent could compute this because you know uh neurons do action potential they don't do numbers so the novelity in fr's approach is to propose algorithm well more of a you know physical process uh that could approach optimal bii inference so the optimal inference of hypothesis given evidence through mization of something called veral free energy uh you don't need to know exactly what this formula is what is important is that it's something that uh is always higher to S price so if you minimize our energy you minimize Sur price you approach uh perfect ban model of what is going on around you and if you assume that uh NE activity layer upon layer upon layer of NE activity self organize like that to infer the causes of sensory stimuli uh they will effectively predict upcoming signal in a way that Nables adaptive understanding navigation of the world and this is pretty much what the active inference uh Paradigm is assuming that the brain does that um we will not try to illustrate what exactly we mean by you know active infective processing the core idea is that you brain predicts sensation given prayer knowledge out of the world so please look at the screen look at the sentence in the middle of it do not look away and pick something in your peripheral vision for example I'm picking a water bottle at my right and while still looking at the screen you don't glance at the object you picked you try to make out as much detail as possible about it I'm going to predict two things for most of you you will be confident about knowing what it is you will see what it is but also you won't be able to see any single detail that tells you what it is for example I'm seeing water bottle I know it is water bottle but I just see a blue thing I do not have the detail to know it's water bottle it could be a vase for all I can see but I have the information that it is indeed a water bottle because I put it there I'm remembering that if I want to drink I need to fetch it so I know it's water bottle and I see water bottle um you can now look away from the screen so uh what this illustrates is that your perception is at a pretty basic level embedded in par knowledge and this is something that we have known more or less intuitively since a pretty long time for example this is the rabbit and dock illustration that with gin really liked and I will predict once again that when you see this illustration you see either a rabbit or a duck and you may you know if I look at the what would be the back of the head of the rabbit or the mouth of the uh sorry the back of the head of the duck or the mouth of the rabbit I see the rabbit if I look at the ears SLB I see a duck but I always see one at a time I don't see you know a complex to the Fields uh for which I have uh duck value and rabbit value as a computational System Mod I see a rabbit or I see a duck and this is again because my perception is embedded in Prior Concepts I have about the world and I know about rabbits I know about duck and I will perceive either rabbit or a duck knowing those are pretty much two different kind of things I cannot perceive both so active in France entails that perception works as I said it would under practive processing but also that actions work the same so in a sense under active inference agents will engage with the World by maximizing the ban coherence which is predicting in a sense the kind of predicting you do by minimizing veral free energy uh of central motor States with PR belief through both perception and action and what this means is that I for example if I don't know about my uh what is the water bottle I may glance at it but also if I want water I will you know take it I will expect myself to solve the problem I have the fact I want water and this is this expectation that will lead to the sending of motor signals uh that enable me to grab the bottle this is a bit abstract because you know cognitive Neuroscience it's mostly math but I want to make very clear why this matters uh in engineering signal engineering uh control engineering this kind of stuff there is a very wellknown problem that is called the inverse problem if you have a forward model of the world so how things move and even if this model is well known and well behaved directly inferring what is going on in the world requires to work not with the forward model but with it inverse and most of the time it's not feasible let's take an example what do you see I will strongly expect that you see a big blurred thing with red and orange this is a painting of Willam Blake the Ancient of Days and just by applying bluring to it which is a very simple process we all understand you can destroy the information about it so that you cannot tell what is going on with the painting and this is in general a problem with any kind of inversion even if you know the process that builds your sensation you do not necessarily know um how to infer what is going on from your sensation and the same goes for motor control even if you perfectly how your body moves you don't necessarily know what command to send to create this or this or this consequence and if you can calculate it it will be very costly and it will be likely very fragile against both uh noise uh ambiguity any kind of error in perception it will not it will be very very very bad for adaptive control they hiding on the run all the time and uh active INF frence because agents do not compute uh explicit representation of the world but comput or you know process physically what they expect to sense and what they expect to do given context they can perform ative control without being subject to the inverse problem because there is no inversion there is just a for model of what I see what I do and this is why inference is most likely correct in my opinion and this is why uh it's very important in context that your actions flow from expectation and not from explicit planning but this has nonrival consequences for how we experence the world I don't I don't know what I said but it does have very obvious consequences for how we experience the world so because you anticipate in a joint manner both motor States and sory states you will experience reality as a landscape AFF for denes where a fores is a technical psychology term for opportunity for Action so let's take again the water bottle the point would be that I do not only see it as you know array of pixel that are blueish I mostly see it as opportunity for drinking and as something that affs grabbing so I can grab it I can drink for it and this is something that is very basic in my perception of the bottle let's take another example so this is a path and if you look at the uh color uh it's pretty much only green everywhere you kind of see a thing in the middle but you know from a pure um colorometric statistical perspective it's not obvious but you see a path this is likely the first thing you saw about this picture and if I remove it and I wait a while ask you to remember what it is I predict that you will remember there is a path and there is green and there are trees and if I ask could remember exactly which trees are where you will not remember that or you may have an idea of it and now I put it back will see that your idea of it is likely false at least how it work every time I could check in real life whether or not people remembered precisely layout of the things the point is you remember you perceive from this picture mostly the fact you can walk in the center of it you perceive mostly an affordance and you also perceive basic person Concepts green trees but you're keeping in mind only information that is CRI IAL for you to navigate it and every time you need more information you will not take it from a abstract model of everything that exist in the world will just glance and this is from that that you have the impression of knowing a lot about your environment because when you don't know about something you can just glance it's not because you have a full presentation of everything you have seen up to this point this would again not be something competition possible and what I take from this notion of experiencing the world as a landscape of for denes is that it entails the disolution of agency as we know it I have to say agency as we know it because if I just say agency ND will be upset and I do not want one to be upset because it pays me so it will say agency as we know it in the sense that you do not have a perception of the worlds that you take as a array of facts for taking decision that you then apply everything is embedded when you see something you already see what you're going to do with it you already see the valance that it hases for you both in term of action that you can do in terms of emotional consequences etc etc your uh perception action Cycles are not entailed by some kind of central executive agency also executive function do play a role they flow with yourself model what you expect yourself to do be context and this means that context pretty much decides for you in a sense at least it can and this is from there that we build the acting FR notion of uh social evolution social organization uh the idea that was argued by R and by visier is that uh humans will integrate a shap shape expectation about agents such as themselves if I see people stopping at a stop sign I would infer that you have to stop at a stop sign and that this is something that applies to me personally and this means that we develop a shared landscape of cultural affordances affordances again mean possibilities for action and cultural affordances just mean that those are culturally constructed and those affordances they you know are not just something that exist in some abstract space that we think about when we want and that we can decide when we apply them and when we don't they directly shape what we see about the world and what we expect to do so under active inference what we actually do this is what I call embeded normativity and this entails again that we particip participatively construct uh landscape that regulates or at least participate regulate at the very least contextualize every single action and perception that we can possibly do everything and this see is a pretty strong result and it seems that it can explain you know a lot about op evolution of culture but does it we will now take a look at the formal grounding of active inference the bit of mathematics that is understood to to land it most if not all of its legitimacy which is called the FY principle we are getting into the math stuff I'm sorry for those of you I don't like it I promise it's interesting so if we assume uh stochastic dial system dmal means it moves stochastic means it has a random components and assuming that the system is partition between a b e an agent a boundary environment and that uh the states of the agent and the environment are independent from each other given those of B so all information you have about a uh sorry all information that you could have in E about a it's inside B which is expressed in the equation in the middle of the screen I don't want to explain too much about it if you can read it you can read it if not we'll go back to something less mathematical pretty soon then there is what we call a information geometry so a geometry of the information that is in the system and given states of a the agent it gives you a belief a distribution over the states of e and this beliefs they minimize rational F energy so the thing that we said that if it was verified it would entail creative processing at inference it is verified in theal case given the statistical independence of two system so pretty much everything does cognition in the active INF sets terms and and condition do apply to the statement so uh first when we talk about um The Mark of blanket essentially what we mean is that there is a individuation there is an identity of the agent in the environment in the sense that it's a bit technical mathematically but intuitively in the sense that they are separated by something that the agent can act on and the agent can sense for example motor and sensory States and the at least from a information theoretic perspective interaction is unlim mediated by states of the boundary and again in the context of AC INF France and the friendship principle it is taken as the Criterion for the existence of a as a individual system something that also is very important to this interactive active inference thing is that the entire ID of predicting one's own action uh depend on a condition that we call strange part Arles where uh there is no direct observation possible effective States so if I do not have a direct way to observe what I do causally speaking my internal states are not directly affected by active States then you have this process of predicting one's election and then you have What Hoe phos ofer of friend calls self- evidencing so self- evidencing means that in an legent gathers proof of its own existence through action uh I hope you remember this notion of basian coherence between a model and sensory motor States this is it if you maximize the basian coherence between your prior beliefs what you think the world is and what you think you are in the world and what you actually experience you're Gathering proofs for a model that corresponds pretty much directly to your own existence so this is quite critical it's the foundation stone over which this entire active inference principle because of lies and so I'm you know accentuating it a bit what's important uh mathematically is the relation between this notion of model of the world and self model and the active action and perception that an agent um enacts so we have to look a bit more at the mathematics um I need to explain more mathematical things a go Theory sorry is a mathematical Theory where uh the Dynamics of a system are caused by its geometry more specifically by symmetries in this system so first we have to define the term of symmetries symmetries are a familiar transformation that do not affect a system so for example what you can see on the screen is the ceiling of the isar mosqu and what you can see is that you can just switch it a bit I did not calculate how much precisely but you can you know rotate it a bit and this won't change the picture this won't change any observable property of the system this is what we call Symmetry and in this case it is a discrete rotational symmetry you can have a lot of symmetry the principle is you can apply a transformation to the system that modifies nothing about it and most physical forces that are known are go theories electricity is a go Theory uh weak force is a strong is a we go Theory strong force is a gge theory all of which are compatible in their description draw it is another go Theory which is not really compatible with others for reason I do not will not get into but in a sense you have a thing called the Einstein ilber tensor that described the geometry of SpaceTime given the density of matter in it and this tensor is by construction inv variant under coordinate change you can move it around it doesn't change the system this is what we mean by relativity and it is this symmetry this symmetry is sufficient to entail the entirety of Relativity Theory and the entire idea of the geometry of space time that you know causes a change in the acceleration of particles so this is NE this is a very powerful mathematical tool that changes you know complex equation into oh this is invariance that's it and there is an argument there is a pretty strong argument that active inference is a goge theory and it is a goge theory that uh is entailed by the symmetries in the probability of presence of the system in a you know specific subart of the system I need to spend a bit of time over this actually the math is only going worse from there you are one so what you see on your screen the picture is is the decomposition between the conservative and the despective components of the atomous flow of a system on the left what you can see that is wobbling around is a conservative flow so it's something that I don't need to explain the specific mathematics but essentially this is what happens when you throw a rock and there is no exchange of energy there is no IR evolution of the system and the dispa component of the flow it is on the contrary what happens the attraction toward the specific subset of the system that will take energy to do its stuff and when you you can decompose anyx this way and when you look at this system what it does is that the dissipative component of the flow will attract the system toward the synchronization manifold which is in a sense the most likely trajectory of a system so for example you will uh wake up drink coffee go to the restrooms uh Drive walk to work should you should walk to work I guess uh work go to lunch Etc ET Etc this how you do things and if you skip some steps like you forget to eat especially three days in a row you will be in a pretty bad State and you will won't be able to do uh your usual stuff anymore and there is a force that attacks on the Dynamics of your brain and that enforces states that are at least roughly coherent with this routine most likely trajectory this is the dissipative component of flow and this is the gorge Force entailed by the symmetries in the probability um of presence of the system the agent Nan system in its you know set space okay this was abstract I'm sorry and essentially there is argument made by myself and sangta and friston that uh because the Dynamics of the system are pretty much set at least within theal System Theory this Force reduces to the dispersion of attention given PR beliefs so if I'm thirsty that was not a setup if I'm thirsty I will pay attention to water and as we said prior attention perception is always lad on with value it's lad on with what you can do with something attention to the activity of opening my bottle and starting to drink I swear to you this was not me setting up this I was thirsty and just took the water bottle I did not think about it this was not me making a point so um I would say this is very nice all of this is very you math I like math but maybe we are running into a problem of circularity because under active inference we accept that the dyamics of the agent flow from uh the beliefs of the agent their priors and more specifically the symmetries in those prayer beliefs but also in the context of the FP we take those belief to constitute the attrac distribution of the agent for system the actual probability of the system to go there and there so the beliefs are entailed by uh the Dynamics which are entailed by the beliefs there is a circularity problem in that your def your definition of a system uh well defines not only the system but everything it can possibly do this means you cannot have this you know uh ruon type uh phenomena where your structure produces is new activity Which shapes the structure in no way because again everything is entailed by the symmetries of the system and you could say renormalization you could say path integral you could say a lot of words but and the system the FP is Def in the context of Ni System Theory this is what they do the stem theory is a theory where um you have a space like Dimension X you have a time like Dimension T and you have a function Fe that defines uh in a sense a flow in time so a flow in zero time is zero and a flow in T1 time and then a flow in T2 time is equal to a flow in T1 plus T2 time this is uh just C condition that entail that ensure this is actually a flow in time and this Theory represents with maximal generality the evolution of a system that is well defined that has an actual aming space which evolves in time along with Welling flow so that have physical Dynamics let us say and in essence this framing is not General enough to describe open-ended change or so I would argue and here we go in the how do you say main course of this talk the notion of contextuality is relation to active inference core point I'm making so in quantum physics we have to talk about quantum physics I'm sorry I I said it was only getting worse in quantum physics um there is a you know well defined physical space but there are are somewhat weird and they are known to be somewhat weird so we don't consider the states of system per se we consider wave function which are basically probability solution over what could the system be and those way function most of quantum physics is defined by the action of operators which are Matrix like linear operators acting on wave function and because of this you can frame everything in quantum physics almost everything as linear algebra and then in linear algebra you have a magic decomposition that tells you that everything in context every Matrix is characterized by igon vector and igon values so for any operator you can uh find a basis of vectors that cover the entire State and each vector when is just multiply by something when you apply the operator to it and this is sufficient to define the operator so you take the operator e you take a basis of X Lambda for different Lambda and for each of this x Lambda e appli to X Lambda is equal to Lambda time x Lambda what is written on the screen good enough and when in quantum physics you perform a measurement on a system X the outcome of this measurement is an value for example it could be a energy level and the probability that you have to find the second value is equal to the probability of basically uh the wave function projected on this Subspace corresponding to the value so the sub space that if you apply the operator to it is multiplied by the good value and then the system is updated by well this uh the projection of its wave function onto the Subspace there is a bit of normalization to do but in essence it's as it's written so if you did not follow lot of that not a problem I just need to explain how cont meas work to introduce the next concept that will actually do the work so uh there is is such a thing as commutativity which exists when you can apply two things in any order that you like so for example you could have operator and you can apply uh the E1 then E2 or you could apply E2 then E1 and there is no difference in anything we call that commutation if E1 and to commute then uh you can measure any system in any order and you will get the same results but General case unless E1 any2 share igen basis so the X Lambda uh different application of the two in different order will give you different results with different probability so this property means that Quantum properties as they are observable fundamentally depend on the basis of measurements so the basis of value with which uh you look at the system and it is not just that there is noise in measurements as you would have in a classical system it is that the way look at them fundamentally defines the way they are postmeasurement and this property is called contextuality okay so uh contextuality is pretty related to plan Evolution horis will see and it is not something that you can uh integrate within DST uh at least not with the philosophy that uh the FP has and why it use DST so if the time Dimension is commutative so T1 plus T2 is equal to T2 plus T1 then the doesn't AFF contextuality you can apply uh T1 plus T2 or T2 plus T1 these are the same thing this give the same results you could decide that the time Dimension is non commutative but then you do not have a natural uning of time the evolution of the system in the time Dimension becomes a creative process where the agent could go any different way that he likes with different results so this is incoherent with the physical intuition that is behind DST as it's used by the F which is to show the emerence of mindl property beliefs from very simple physical property Lal system property if you just assume that your system is somehow creative by construction yeah you will get mindline property but you're not explaining it so uh this entails a kind of conflict between active inference and um the mathematical basis that it claims to have so AC inference tells you that it grounds the description of cognitive agency cognitive engagement by Taking Back Dynamic the kind of stuff that you have when you take a bunch of neuron and just check them uh be gical synchronization M blanket so statistical Independence blanket as we defined and because of the FP we can say that this entails the implicit prediction of sensor active States and this grounds cognitive agency this is the core claim of active inference but classical L does not allow to does not all the description of a creative process where states of the world like letters take a new meaning and tell new Dynamics are made up along the way it does not give you complexity so it doesn't give you the constructive aspect of cognition because this is the same thing now if we want to address this mathematically we have to go in a kind of weirder more esoteric Direction uh specifically what we get when we look at the thermodynamics observation so observation when it is constrained by an agent internal flow has to bring about physical States uh in the sense of well survivals that have a causal power on things the reason for this is not some weird uh pen rows or car stuff it's just theonomics if You observe an object if you are an agent s and You observe object o you are getting information by Lor principle this entails hitting so this entails the creation of entropy this entropy has to go somewhere so it has to destroy information this is what entropy is if you look at something and you make it exist in the sense of uh some observable that has caal power you have to destroy the possibility for observing something else so meaningful obs ation observation that you remember because if you forget about it you do not have the same condition entails the loss of information in the environment the lack of definition of what you are not looking at because uh of either hitting forgetting or Quantum de coherence the reason why is developed in techark 2012 paper I won't explain the mathematics now but I suggest you look at it and something that we can claim from it if we are feeling ad serious which I am is uh following F and uh this schol of quantum B asianism that you can pretty much reduce Quantum cosmology so the construction of space physical SPAC as we understand them relies critically on context you just need contextuality understood as the construction of relevant observables from the choice of context by the agent and build from that spaces so in the 2013 paper that I putting here there is a demonstration of this in a specific subcase again I will not explain the mathematics I will just say that uh the mathematics IC work to show that it is possible is ongoing there is no definit demonstration that this is the math we need to use but we have reason to believe this exists there exists such math and uh when we look at the role of apologies I forgot to mention this idea that physical spaces and physical observables are brought about in an unal sense by agency by choice of context by agent is called paratory realism and it's core to the Bist view of cosmology Bist like AC inference so when we apply this notion of pp realism to humans um what I want to say and again I will have to be a bit short on the math is that assuming this uh thinking through other mind thing from earlier assuming that humans think of themselves as instance of a human type that has properties that has expected action uh then and assuming contextuality of course then successive cycle of observation or integration and an action of social constraints understood as single expectation over what you supposed to do entails uh or at least enables the description of a continuous proc cess of open ended reconstruction of cure landscape and this we know is opened because of the contextuality which affords by construction change this is pretty much what it means and from there we can have a dual understanding of the integration and in action of constraints or Landscapes that are built culturally and their evolution through the Contex of the experience so a signal phenomenality builds both commity structure and its Evolution this is nice so uh let us try to sum up what was said here uh first there is such a thing as par participatory realism um which claims that physical spaces and physical observables are built brought about by the agency of observers in our case cognitive agent and this applies to the specific case of Human Social evolution by claiming that the the relation between structure so the Dynamics of a given landcape and function so the meaning it takes for individuals is a core driver of many Evolution we have this ribbon shaped thing where structure builds new stuff which sorry builds new function you meaning that shape structure in a constructive way and this process cannot be with DST because DST tells you what the structure is it is what defines a gical system the flow it has so you cannot have evolution of flow within DST it's not a thing so to address this I propose to borrow the antique regime that is defined for quantum physics at least by Quantum bism which is pism and which states that the existence of stuff uh observables spaces deres from contextuality from the role of context in defining physical reality and uh from my own work and the work of frosto I will claim that it translates quite directly in the contextual nature of cognition the fact that we understand the world through Concepts and not through you know inting perception of what's out there this applies in particular to the case of uh human evolution Human Social Evolution because we can describe assuming AC inference and assuming that a contextual interpretation of it the Human Social and cognitive activity can be described as the construction and the action of a sh system of social constraints uh which shape public behavior and private thoughts through the expectation that they build over behavior and over attention and this is an illustration of that process and The Duality it entails between the enaction of structure and its reconstruction and what's interesting with this concept is if you have constraints and if you have a system of constraint that is closed where each constraint is brought about by other bonds you have what mon moio to an activist researcher Define as a form of life as biological organization and therefore this entire contextuality thing not only explains the evolution in the context of social social cultural Evolution but it also places this contextuality at the center of you know the constructive aspect of life so it may be used to build the new mathematics of life that accounts for organization and open-ended Evolution um this entails that humans can be understood as a model well Human Social cultural life forms can be understood as a model for a broader understanding of life and in that BR understanding about life to to build it we need first to understand how humans set the context for social activity so like thiser in a sense I think that this is because we think about what we do in a sense that is reflexive we have what we call the existential stance which is the attitude of reflecting over what one would do in this context reflecting about uh the interaction in disembodied abstract terms and this entails at least this participate in the construction of many things so for example uh taking roles within interaction taking the role of the EXP of the picture a designer developer tester of software this enables also to have a reflexive understanding of what we mean by specific acts as communicative acts so this entails language and symbolism this enables uh material symbolism in the sense of monumentality shaping materal landscape so as to build certain meaning into this landscape and this enable ritual the embodied synchronous activity that is meant to have a specific function that is meant to entail specific norms and build specific emotions all of this is part of how humans set the context social activity and all of this is stuffff for which we have a lot of information so we can try at least to build mathematics to understand that and I wanted to conclude on that saying by Regenstein so you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false it is what Humans Beings say that is true and false and they agree in the language they use that is not agreement in opinion but in form of life which is my opinion the extent that we understand interpret Stein just a way to say that what is Meaningful what is constraining in human activity is not the specific nature the literal meaning of a statement it's the choice of framings and it's the context that is set by the language used by people which is my opinion a kind of visionary way to understand to preface all of this stuff so I was of course not able to say a lot about the mathematic are really the mechanics that I suppose about all this stuff I had to stick to the basics and I think you would agree that Basics were you know a bit abstract so I would strongly suggest that you look at uh the stuff I wrote about this I have two papers uh one on the right is contextuality cognitive engagement in France which is a quite barebones argument that contextuality is indeed intrinsic to cognition and critical to explain what need change and the other on the left from the existential stance to constraints is a thicker more committed arguments that indeed there are such a thing as soci from life that are entailed by social constraints social constraints built by ex existential stance as understood under active inference so the entire program so thank you for listening I hope that it did not get to abstruct like moderates acceptable on to acception and I guess I will take uh on the questions thank you AAL awesome all right I'll I'll start with writing uh with one question I wrote down and then look forward to anyone's questions in live chat so how do modeling and active inference techniques like structure learning Dynamic mark blanket detection language like notations for generative models deal or not with this question of the open-endedness of life and evolution depends which technique and how it's applied I'd have to look at the U find Prints but you just to unpack why I'm asking and then maybe it'll be a little clearer is like you brought in this question of the open-endedness so what is the theoretical challenge posed have prior methods been inadequate and what would be the case if there were some type of model flexible applications that could could track open-endedness or is that impossible I don't want to commit on possibility because uh I guess so all of this relies on the idea that the choice of State space is not natural it's built by a system through its activity so I don't want to commit to abstract possible possible depends on what is interesting to you in the process so uh for example if I take structure learning if you have some uh if you have some mechanism to uh postulate New Concepts through which a system will engage with the world this is the kind of thing that drives my change my point is not that it's impossible to do my point is that it's not underwritten by the FY principle because the F principle is fral Theory where you have a fixed amount of stuff and specific flow in the stuff space so if you want to do concept learning you will have to postulate new things and it won't be as physically principal as it is under the FP so what you would need to ground physically this kind of stuff is something else or maybe a more specific updated version of the FP I don't know but not something that is framed strictly speaking within ecosystem Theory awesome makes a lot of sense okay I'll ask a question from the chat anyone else can write okay Susan wrote do social activities depend on individual allostatic capabilities allostatic oh yeah like um how you say so the core argument I would say that is in the social constraint stuff is that um let's say there is a coherence of what the constraints are between individuals so for example the concept of money applies to you it applies to me applies to anyone who lives pretty much in a urban context uh that does not mean that it applies the same to anyone money won't mean the same for me or you as it would mean for Elon Musk because uh for example this is a okay this is I'm getting Technical and finance but uh people who are really really rich like that are valued in billions they do not actually have money on their bank accounts what they have is how do you say actions um shares in stuff which is valued billions and they use it as leverage to get loans after loans after loans after loans after loans so they get free money basically this is not money that they they spend um so this does not mean the same thing when we say money depending um on whether we're considering the perspective of you know working class or even normal person a billionaire a bank a state all these agent can engage with money in different Manner and uh you can make sh up essentially you can decide that no I don't do a 10 bill you can invent new relate to thing you can uh for example you can build a come on pool a bank basically with friends it's allowed you can do it you can build new meaning into things and this is something I don't know if you see my cursor but that is entailed by the integration of social constraints because when I act in the context of constraints okay I'm constrainted these are constraint what I'm allowed to do with them any anything I can do with them basically I'm allow to project the meaning and to build I like and this means that this uh system of constraint will change with time because people will find new way to use it to the advantage and yes this is related to allostatic load this is related to pretty much anything including a bily signal that is relevant for me to Define my strategy the difficulty again is to repr mathematically how novelty occurs because we can't just track every single state of everything and if we did that still does not tell you where money is there is no money parameter in the big bank this is not the thing so money has been made up people have been made up Vision has been made up and the core difficulty that I'm trying to point out is to build mathematics that allow for this kind of construction of meaningful observable States and yes again agenc is important in it so allostasis is how do you think that active inference picks up on that challenge of being able to model that so uh conceptually there is the entire inactive semiotics thing so active inference allows you to think of cognitive engagement as something that's embeded in Concepts uh so in agency and the context that agents project into the world and this is very good uh this is I think the why we should think about perception action uh problem is that the math do not follow the math do not math um again we justify active inference based on framework that is built within DST contextuality and therefore change is not something that is afforded by the SD there is uh so I assume someone in the chat is saying yes but what about what Chris Fields is doing yeah Chris Fields is doing a strange categories stuff that has I would say the capability to show change because it has very few mathematical constraint it does not have the kind of constraints you find within set theoretical approaches I would say uh the issue is that you do not have uh this basic intuition of just be synchronization building new stuff because the mathematical framework is very general and it's not just bare synchronization anymore it's I I don't even know what it is it's info how you say infom morphism I don't know what infom morphism is like I have a definition in mind but I do not know what to do with it so I would say there is a lot of work uh that remains to be done to build meaningful phys physical intuition about this process because basically we have the choice between math that are too constrained to describe each change and math that is not constrained enough to explain it in terms of specific constraints and specific patterns of activity yes yes certainly that comes up like what is the most General schema for modeling a cognitive agent or cultural agent it just a blank spec the less the schema says the more General it is and the less is there and the more degrees of freedom and modler is the free energy principle which your talk also did a great job of bringing into and out of quickly um is architecture independent it's some relationships and and Frameworks that that meet in active inference with the bottom up embodied extended etc etc lineage and ecological psychology and all of the actual model constructivism and instrumentalism and it's it's it's interesting how uh yeah you what do you think about this I'm not try the where you're going at I'm sorry okay Jesse wrote the problem with math and physics and any scientific discourse is the models just are more approximate of the error correction criteria the errors are more approximate of the error correction criteria okay um where are you continuing on in your research and work like after seeing things this way or is it laid out in the papers or where else are you going with it so I should really have done a part in the talk about this r i so essentially um I had to stop focusing on the math because I had to look at the sociology and I I have to have to I have to have a proof of work for this entire area of conent and I'm focusing on this application to concrete process of what I call ground building so the construction of the set of Prior that is shared by a community uh mostly the two case studies that I've been focusing on are the unification Church which is um Korean far right Christian Light cult that among other things uh kept the conservative Japanese party in power for 70 years Ed the journal Regan was weding and according to CIA I did not verify could a country in South America so as you can see very varant points for Cults and uh they are mostly known because of their ability to generate huge M panics around their cive practices for Recruitment and fundraising and so I uh wrote a paper about um an active Insurance approach to this um to this recruiting and you know conversion strategies which was successful um because something we have with active inference and that is hard to address from a pure EOG ethnographic perspective is the integration between you know the Linguistics what we say and uh the base cognition how we experience something this is something that cogn cognitive science cognition is something that cognitive science studies pretty well I think um and the other major case study I've been uh working on is the construction of the landscape in the SI de balena which is archeological sites studed by Escape where you have a lot of FAL mounts that are you know playing around and who may or may not have a structuring role in the navigation of the area and so I've been doing Theory and modeling on what's going on there that is very interesting Dare I ask how the Mounds play a role in the navigation of the area uh so it is claimed that basically if you go from mount to mount you are pretty close from a optimal path to travel through landscape which is very rid so it's not trivial to know where you're supposed to go I would say the non-trivial question is at least in the context of the did people intend to use the Mounds as a you know landmarks to help with navigation and I would say our core point is that intent at least in the common sense is not that important because from the moment those PHS are built they do shap the landscape like it does not matter when you say this that what you profoundly mean in your inner self because there is no such thing as a inner self there is what you do the context in which you do it and how it shapes the context and I would say this is pretty core to this approach of ground building that I've uh tried to construct and illustrate interesting it makes me think about sort of the first and third person biosemiotic perspectives like when it comes to ant colony phermone modifications of the environment or nest building intention wouldn't come so much into play yet it may dominate aspects of our experience so considering well is the biosemiotic event of the pheromone perception or the mountain navigation or or the reading or writing of an environmental mark in what ways does the causal consequence or experience from the first person perspective Accord with the outside behavioral observation from the third person perspective which sort of strips the experience of intentionality yet does so with methods like intentional inference and and inference to latent States proposed by modelers so clearly part of the modelers constraint however the reference of those modeling constraints is the biological constraint so so I guess this is uh something that's pretty critical in in the approach I'm proposing what we think of intentionality pretty much does not exist because uh the Baseline model that we have in accidental safety is you have a body and you have a mind and the mind shows the body this is not a thing um well you have a perception and you use this perception to decide and act and this is not a thing your perception of the environment is integrated to perception of yourself which is a direct cause for your behavior so intentions are embedded in the environments and this is true for ants and the biosmetics of you know um what's it called well Fons and this is true for Cults so for example uh there is a antire debate around are the munis so the cult unification Church cult are they con artists I don't know I don't care I don't know if they believe in what they say I I think they do I don't think that changes the morals of the situation because they have buil the system and the system is bad and we do not have we can just cize the context what it is what makes people do and again thinking about whether uh people intend to build something bad in the Deep of their inner selves is not a meaningful question because there is no such thing as in yourself there is what you think to yourself it's a thing but there is no self that is not embedded in some context of operation this is not if yourself is what you expect yourself to do how you expect yourself to behave your self model that it's always elled in something at least self talk there is no way to escape that so again there is no um let's say the notion of intention that we can motivate based on cognitive science fields of conition it's much more minimal than the stuff that we expect and that we uh usually it take to be necessary for responsibility so there is a problem and as far as I'm concerned this problem can be solved from like sociologically by the anal of premises by the analys of well social constraints of the common ground of social interaction and I would be pretty confident in it because if we can't do that we can't do anything cool um do you want to add any more comments or what else are you thinking about or how would you want to see people pick this up and continue uh read my papers that's the simpler stuff I'm trying to do an advert for them I'm trying to show relance at least but again it's mostly math no one understand math by talking that's not a thing I don't think so at least so I would highly recommend that you take a look look at the paper which go in much more detail about for example the mechanics of social cognition as I understand them and I strongly suggest that you look into the social sciences project on the active influence of sorry the active influence institutes that I am founded I guess I can say that and send me anything that you uh that you would want me to look at and I will look at it and I want to build new stuff from that this is the core message and I think it's pretty possible pretty easy pretty constructive pretty productive good things awesome I want to ask so many questions about the social science project but that's a great way to end it and I I would look forward to it being reactivated this year too yeah let's do this cool thank you a thank you bye for
