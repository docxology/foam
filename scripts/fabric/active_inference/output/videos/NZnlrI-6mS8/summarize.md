# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The presentation discusses the relationship between active inference, social change, and the mathematics of open-ended evolution in cognitive archaeology.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference connects cognitive science and social evolution through mathematical modeling.
2. Open-ended evolution refers to creating new concepts not pre-existing in nature.
3. Three types of explanation in cognitive science: nomological, mechanical, and functional.
4. Active inference explains cognition via a Bayesian model predicting sensory inputs.
5. Human perception is influenced by prior knowledge and contextual affordances.
6. Contextuality in quantum physics relates to how measurements affect system states.
7. Social constraints shape individual behavior and collective cultural affordances.
8. Mathematical grounding in active inference needs to accommodate open-ended change.
9. Cognition is not purely internal; it is embedded in social and physical contexts.
10. Future research aims to develop mathematics for understanding social dynamics and constraints.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference can model cognitive engagement as influenced by social contexts.
2. The concept of open-ended evolution challenges traditional mathematical frameworks in cognitive science.
3. Social constraints are crucial in shaping individual and collective behaviors.
4. Understanding human cognition requires looking beyond internal states to external interactions.
5. Future work should focus on integrating social dynamics into mathematical models of cognition.
