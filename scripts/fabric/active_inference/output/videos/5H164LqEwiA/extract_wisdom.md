# IDEAS:
- The paper explores collective intelligence and its relation to cognition evolution, emphasizing symbiosis.
- Active inference provides a framework for understanding cognition through the lens of collective behavior.
- Folk psychological beliefs can influence scientific understanding, illustrating the interplay between science and culture.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration can enhance our understanding of complex systems, including cognition and biology.
- Biological individuality can be defined through various lenses, including metabolic and immunological perspectives.
- Symbiotic relationships challenge traditional views of Darwinian individuality and highlight evolutionary transitions.
- Cognition may not be limited to traditional biological systems but can extend to artificial intelligence.
- The free energy principle allows for a deeper understanding of how systems interact and adapt.
- Collective behavior can emerge from simple interactions, leading to complex system dynamics.
- The paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing different types of individuals in biological research.
- Affective states may play a crucial role in defining cognition and individual experience.
- Emotional awareness could influence the effectiveness of symbiotic relationships and collective intelligence.
- The niche environment can adapt to organisms, influencing evolutionary dynamics and cognitive development.
- Systems can exhibit emergent properties that are not reducible to their individual components.
- The concept of users and resources highlights the interaction between organisms and their environments.
- Reciprocal multi-scale integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems.
