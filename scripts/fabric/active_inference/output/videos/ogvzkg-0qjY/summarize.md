# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The cohort meeting focuses on active inference principles, emphasizing generative models, project discussions, and collaborative learning in chapters six to ten.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cohort one continues with chapters six to ten of the active inference textbook.
2. Participants are encouraged to engage and share questions during sessions.
3. The generative model's design is crucial for understanding active inference applications.
4. Project ideas are discussed, emphasizing collaborative learning and development.
5. The importance of defining the system of interest in modeling processes is highlighted.
6. Framing questions is essential for effective model building and purpose alignment.
7. The generative process and model must be distinguished for proper learning simulations.
8. Discussions include the challenges of identifying Markov blankets from data.
9. Model adequacy and validation depend on the purpose of the modeling effort.
10. The meeting encourages iterative learning and contributions to coding practices in active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the generative model is key to active inference applications.
2. Collaborative discussions enhance learning and project development in the cohort.
3. Framing the right questions is critical for effective model building.
4. Identifying the system of interest aids in accurate modeling processes.
5. Iterative coding practices can improve accessibility and functionality in active inference projects.
