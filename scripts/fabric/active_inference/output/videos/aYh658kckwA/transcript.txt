hi everyone thank you for joining us today we have math art stream nine and today is October 4th 2024 we will be talking about the expanse and Hector please take it away okay thank you Shana well I need to give some background information I'm going to talk about the books and then um all other colleagues here will discuss also the TV series but they want to make clear that now I'm going to refer to the books and the expanse is a series of nine science fiction novels by James sa Cory which is the joint pen name of authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Frank the series start with h the title lethan wakes and ends with the F title of Leviathan Falls and there are a couple of things I would like to mention about the books the first one is that you never think there are two authors so this is a very Coen way of narrating the stories which is very good I mean it it tells very well about the the writing skills of the authors the second thing I need to tell for to those of you who have watched the TV series and enjoy them is that you need to go to the books because the book are great the books are I mean they won't disappoint you and when you start with the first book you see that it is really good it's good or better than the TV series and then you always fear that they are going to drag but they never do so they are getting better and better or at least they are keeping the highest standard so they are highly recommendable okay and that being said let's see this goes what I'm going to tell you now is what I think that makes this book serious so enticing what gives them their credibility and why do we connect so intimately with the characters and here I need to tell people also that this is my take on the books this is my personal analysis of the books it doesn't need to coincide with the intent of the authors but I think that there are elements of theory of Mind here and some storytelling devices they apply whether they know it or not that they make these books really creeping and so this is my analysis of that I think that one of the secrets of the books and why they are so good is that the story is narrated from the characters outward perspective and I'm going to to give some more detail about this each chapter follows a character through their daily routines and Adventures so the read reader virtually accompanies the character providing a taste of the unfolding events and fostering a more intimate relationship with each character so each chapter start with one character like first chapter is Miller and you go with Detective Miller through their daily routines second chapter can be hold them and you accompany Holden and so we have this direct access to the character thoughts also because they are given as information about what they desire their emotions their regrets so we've got this firstand insight into their minds that helps us understand them better making them appear more real than in other fantasy novels or fantasy novels in general it also helps us connect with them it is easier to establish raer okay so we perceive the character as human with their virtues and their flows we share the same human emotions feelings and desires and that's the same Humanity one other aspect that gives power to these books or this narration is that there are plenty of references to mental States this is something pervasive through the story and this makes the narrative deeply introspective the storytelling is deeply personal providing privilege access to the characters inner thoughts and tribulations and the writers here demonstrate a profound understanding of human nature which the reader can easily perceive one other aspect of the narrative that I find is it's very good and and helps to to create this atmosphere is the narrative is riching details related to the embodied experience with frequent allusions to bodily Sensations such as sweat taste and smells there is a wealth of detail regarding the character experiences for instance when they are afraid they describe how their bodies react to the fear if they are hungry they express how their stomach respond and if they are happy they feel it in their belly so to speak and this is a kissing nature of the narrative a rich palette of bodily Sensations associated with the character experiences and this makes them more credible and helps them the reader connect intimately with them sorry so just uh following up with this why do the characters feel so much more real than in other books it's just putting an example imagine yourself facing a massive threat like a breakes fail suddenly you might feel a not in your stomach cold sweat and accelerated PSE and tense muscles perhaps even some Noosa these are natural bodily reactions a take over by the sympathetic nervous system preparing you for fter flight now imagine the same situation under the influence of high doen dipin or Al tranquil your sympathetic nervous will be DED your reactions less sharp and those bodily Sensation will be muted the lack of the reactions Bo tool your cognitive response making the threat feel less real and returning to the expanse with this description of the way your body experiences things and emotions not only do you know what threats the characters face or what excites them but you also understand how their bodies react to this situation and this provide a rich a palette to represent how the story infolds allowing your body to Vicar experience the character Sensations and this deep dive into the characters and their story makes them feel more real okay so this constant reminder of the character's bily experiences helps you perceive them as more authentic making the story feel more viid and real as well I think this is one of the main secrets of the books there is a constant reference to the body sensation of the characters this is something you don't find that often in other books and I think this is building up this atmosphere is building up this connection with the characters and you don't even notice it but you are getting inside the characters and here I just got some except from the book that reflect this deep dive into the movements of the characters and for instance these are things I copy pasted from the books this one I seen in which detective Miller is interviewing a girl and you see in bold there are all these references to small movements for instance uh it was smiling gentle encouragement you can picture the the smile of this detective then the girl was waving a hand have Lo that was observing the scene the interview were standing by the door bling to ice the man's face twitch with impatience so you're picturing the face of this guy right and then you have Miller that wave his hand in Imitation of the girl so they describe how the girl wave her hand and then Miller did the same he's mimicking the girl and then the same La the GU used Miller noded and the girl nodded back like they were to birds doing a maing dance this is interesting because they are all the time they are reflecting this mimic actions so we got this movement of the characters and they are mimicking each other mimicking this small gestures and we have more examples for instance then we have one example of another scene um James Holden is with Fred Johnson and detective Miller and they say that the hand terminal of James Holden be to remind me he needs to take the pills so he takes uh pulled out a small bottle you can picture this action took out two blue pills and swallowed them dry and this is interesting again you can imagine yourself trying to swallow two pills without water and at the same time Miller um was pouring pills out of his bottle as well so he's going to mimic the actions of the of James Holden so you about these two guys again doing the same thing at the very same time right um and this is something you find a lot in the book now we have Fred Johnson that is threw his hand terminal down on the left left his ey with the heel of his hand for several seconds and then um so you again are imagining this all these micro movements in the face of BR Johnson and in general what you're finding in throughout the book is that they are describing all these little movements these micro gestures these faal expressions and there is a lot of mimicking between characters and this is something we do every day in our daily lives we are talking to people and we are reproducing their gestures so there is this intimate connection with people that goes through movement and they pick it up in the book and I think this is one of the secret of the narrative also how they capitalize on these micro movements and get this kind of dancing between the characters like mimicking each other all the time one other secret of the books in my reading of them or my my take on these books is that they are very cinematic and they are showcasing the writers Mastery of Storytelling they not only have a profound understanding of human nature as I said before but also skillfully used techniques often employed in movies to an animate The Narrative and this again is my interpretation what I perceive for instance I would say that they use this long T technique of movies which is also known as a continuous take or continuous shot or or wner it is a sh that last much longer than usual the way each chapter follow a different character gives the impression of a long take creating a feeling of continuous unfolding so it's um because they are telling the story from the point of view of these characters you are following them you have the impression that something is is going on something is unfolding and it's very similar to this long take in in cinema another thing that I perceive in the books is a sort of sequence shooting or plan sequence in French which is this technique used to capture a scene from various distances and angles typically including wide medium and close views in films sequence shooting helps create anticipation and maintain the viewers attention in the book some scenes are Revisited by different characters and this provides multiple perspective on the same event so the fact that you visit the same scene um again from the point of view of another character gives you this feeling of sequence shooting and this for revisiting a scene from different characters perspective is this extraordinary the extraordinary narrative device that is occasionally employed in the story and I believe this is the most exciting aspect of the these devices they use this these writers um you are not immediately aware that this is happening until you connect the Dos so the writer achiev this by having one character going through a scene in one chapter and then another character going through the same as scene in the next chapter that's providing different and often contrasting views on the same event so you revisit the same ma scene but you you don't even know until you realize that that's the same but from the point of view of another character I think this is remarkable technique they employ so you have character a experiences an event from their View point and then character B takes over sharing their mental perspective of the same situation and this approach allows you to see the same event through multiple lenses revealing how each participant analyzes it differently and you get this insight into the character's feelings emotions and beliefs which vary because they are different people experiencing the same situation and this mirror real life where we never truly know if others perceive situations as we do often leading to some level of his match or even misunderstanding and this technique for me feels very cinematic as if you are watching a scene from multiple angles simultaneously while also gaining a deeper understanding of the characters and their relationships so now for instance imagine an argument between two characters that they Revisited in two consecutive chapters each narrated from the perspective of one of the characters involved there will always be some degree of mismatch providing deeper insight into the character motivational reactions even when the events are the same their interpretations and action will defer because they are distinct individuals with unique backgrounds and ways of processing information and this approach of privilege access to the character's mental WTH and the intricacies of the relationships as you follow the same core characters throughout the nine books a cumulative effect builds creating a strong sense of connection with them so you really understand the characters because you are visiting these scenes from their points of view different points of views again and again so you are getting to know them very intimately okay one other thing that I would like to say to finish with this um introduction of of ideas is how the characters are convincingly human so you have this characters that are not the typical flat hero uh which is all heroic Deeds you have people that have flows and you really get to know them and you have like this archetypes archetype character like James Holden which is the ideal naive hero always ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good you got Alex Kamal which is the Joker keeps the group cohesive with his humor and ability to lighten the mood you got you've got Roberta Bobby Draper which is the warrior the Marin he's she's professional and and like Amos Barton who is also a warrior she does what she needs to be done like professionally and like you have Amos which is more like at times it's like a sociopath right um then you have for instance um Clarisa Mau which that is the daughter of Jules SP Ma and the older sister of Julie Mau that once was a villain but then redeems herself and ultimately sacrifices her life to protect those who were once her enemies the The Rosy crew and then you have Naomi Nagata of course that a she's a devoted mother has endured much and always puts YY before herself so she persevered doing the right thing and trying to heal her relationships even falling Falling In Love Again despite her traumatic love past and what you find is that these character are deeply human are float are not empty shells of heroic Fearless figures and this is something that you don't find that often in in fantasy epic or in fantasy novels you have people you can connect with and I think two characters that are especially interesting and we can discuss about them is one is Amos Barton because you've got this guy uh there is always tension accompanying him a Readiness for Rob violence yet he is also loyal to all his friends and can protected the weak like Thea DTE or pets even um but it's a very complex character so he was raised in a very deprived and deprived conditions in a kind of criminal environment and he has not learned how to channel his negative emotions so he has a quick recourse to violence but and this is something we see in the book for instance there is one time in the book where Clarissa Mau is dying and she Amos and Clarisa are deeply connected emotionally so Amos wants her to die in the rosinante like home but he cannot do this they are not in the rosinante and he's frustrated so he picks up a epic fight with Bobby Draper who is part of the rosy crew also and they beat the crap out of each other but once he has discharged his anger he is calm again and he can be friends with a bobby again so this Amos is a very complex believe very interesting character because you have these two sides one dark side which is very for violence and can be even a sociopath if you will but then he can be very loyal and and and good to people and protective of weak another character that I find very interesting is that of mar and Admiral Winston D which is a very complex and interesting character so he takes a sample of the Proto molecule with him when he fleas with a Mars and worship and forces scientists to apply to enhance him as well as enhancing his technology and military power and he then establishes a multiplanetary military dict dictatorship declaring himself an emperor of swords and D becomes something alien and barely human so he has transformed himself into something else and he has decided that the only way to defeat those who annihilated the creators of the protom molecule is to turn humankind into a single hi entity and this idea of a hi mind that ADM wi attempt is very powerful and evocative especially with the of active inference well and just to summarize and finalize I would say that the characters of the spans are quite different from those we accustomed to in many epic fantasy novels for instance in The Lord of the Rings which is one of my favorites uh you have these flat characters there is not much psychologically happening there you don't get this deep insight into the characters and I think in the expanse it's the complete opposite you really get into the cus and that gives you this connection with them at a human level and well that was it great no sorry just forgot something sorry Magdalena yeah goe I just forgot to connect it sorry about that I know you missing something yes I wanted to connect with active inference um I think that the throughout the nine books is that the narrative is not just a passive recounting of events it is a constant Symphony movement the small gesture and micro movements of the characters are described in such detail that you can visualize them as if immers in a mating dance so mimicry of this little gesture permeates the interaction of the character throughout the story I find this to be the most remarkable feed of Ingenuity achieved by the authors it is in its own right an oper of movement they tell us story through bodily movement as though the whole story is to some extent embodied by the characters and I think this connects deeply with active inference and now I'm done sorry yay thank you um well I guess it's my turn um for what we agreed um I I think I want to start with a question for you uh ector um and and I I'm very curious about your interest in the expanse and I'm very interested in why someone with your background in cognitive sciences and you can elaborate that a little bit what what your background is I'm curious as to why you picked the uh theory of Mind as a focus and I thought that it would be good for the our audience to hear what is theory of mind and how you connected to this material okay that's a good question yeah sorry I should have describe what the mind is yes can be roughly described as the ability to infer the mental states of other people so I can I don't have access to the mental state of other people I have access access to my own thoughts but I can infer for instance if I see your faces that you are joing I couldn't iner that you are getting Bor and that's I'm accessing your inner thoughts so this is this ability to attribute mental states to other people like Happ happiness or or you know that someone is wanting something because you know this these people or you see someone that is smiling and you infer that something good happened to this person so this is your ability to attribute mental states to third parties that's what we refer to as theory of mind and my interest is that the books are full of mental state attribution and when you follow these characters when you read the books you realize that uh you are given Lots information about what one character thinks about what the other thinks and so on so you've got this complex um process in which one character is thinking something about the other character trying to find out what is crossing the mind of the other character and this is something they do all the time in the books and this give you this deep dive into these guys because you realize that they are trying to guess what the other is wanting or or feeling and they have different takes on the same um the same for instance event so they experience it differently they infer different things and and this is something that they do masterfully these writers I think it's amazing what these guys do I don't know if they even realize how good they are at grasping this ability to infer or to to have these inner thoughts and and wantings and beliefs of people get into I mean inter SP in this story um yeah so that that's really interesting so I I think my what I'm curious about is um I imagine that when you started reading these books Etc and you started thinking about you know you know what's the Magic in these books you know why are they captivating my my interest and so I guess what I'm curious to hear about is um do some of these comments that you've made how do they connect to work that you've done in your lab regarding aspects of human interaction that are pretty unobservable which I think that the the expans captures I think what you're getting at is that human communication is not just about the words that we exchange but it's about all kinds of movement and percept perceiving so much in the context of each individual the way they interact with each other Etc and so um so that aspect that's kind of this messy observable area of of active inference I I love to hear your thoughts on that and to and if even if you've had if you've had done experiments or think about doing experiments along these lines you know how does that how would you link the the two yeah I think it's that um is that the connection with the characters doesn't come by the Deeds they perform as much as by the way you vicariously experience what they experience so I think you because you are reminded of this micro gestures this movement this mimicry um youly do the same things and I think that's a very powerful device they apply I don't know if they know it or not but you find yourself reproducing the action of the of these characters and you get a more intimate connection with them because of that so I don't think that you connect with them because of the things they do like Holden is an idealist I think you connect intimately with them because they do what humans do which is this typical gestures this mimicry and you are described this um bodily Sensations in so much detail that you are experiencing them so I think this is one of the secrets of the books this is my take on the books that you really are connecting with your body not with your mind I mean not with your rational part and this is I think very important in our lives also you are imitating each other all the time and you are connecting with people at a level that is not completely conscious but is affecting you deeply and and I think that's very much has a lot to do with active inference because it's about actions it's all about actions and how you anticipate the action of the other and you enter this kind of play like the pendulum of Christian hens you end up synchronizing uh you do not even know but that's affecting you deeply and I think that's very exciting about these books okay so along those lines you know thinking about active inference um you know if we if we think about and and I don't expect us to to have an answer for this right but if we ask the question what role does the hive mind play in minimizing surprise and free energy right because the the the way that I see the active inference literature is very much it's an individual mind minimizing free energy and minimizing surprise and I think that we all know that actually each mind is just one mind amongst a body of minds and that sapience has this incredible ability where the mark of blanket around the hive mind that matters can be constantly shifting and I think that that boundary shifted through this these the synchronization of these movements and body language and reading each other right so what I want to just share with you I guess the anthropology that would that comes into play is that so my background is an anthropology and I've done a lot of uh field work with small scale societies H gatherers in South America and so I have you know seven years of observations and blah blah and all that great experience and what's really struck me and and thus my you know actor started talking about this it's like I started telling him I don't know what to call this I don't know what to call something that I observed that we couldn't really put a name on which is that the way that activities and decisions were made were not by having a committee meeting and saying okay today we're going to forge at this time then so you you're going to do this you're going to do that no none of that everything happens as though you're watching water as you're watching a school of fish or a school you know birds flying and so it it's exactly like that you know and so this is like the the environment of our supposedly evolutionary adaptiveness right so I live with that those um those uh observations and then I see the expanse and I go oh my gosh this looks just like a 100 gather band and the what these authors have managed to do is to recreate what's essential to humans and what makes us thck and what what I think is what makes us thck is that hi mind right but what creates that hive mind how do we observe it how do we measure it and how we get to the point so that we can put it into models for explaining what's at at the core of um let's say at the core of the biophysics or what's in our brains that gives rise to social connections and so so so I'll say that much and then I'll introduce something else which I it's also another observation I made with hunter gatherers which to this day I find absolutely mind-blowing so I started working with this particular group that made contact in the late 1970s and so when I started working them in the 80s they had it had been pretty recent so they were pretty unacculturated right and then through time the acculturation in this particular group happened incredibly fast uh unlike other groups that I worked with and and I have to give you that background to explain that we ended up having this crazy huge building where the the people the community wanted us to uh show them films from other countries from other like and also like as as weird as possible like you know they were just curious about everything from did man land on the on the moon okay get bring a film about that we want to see that film and so it's so we started bringing films and so and and so we would get you know 100 people sitting on the floor watching this on this huge wall and I would just sit with them like this and it was talking throughout the entire film and what I would listen to is the conversations of people saying telling each other the entire plot that person over there this is what it's not this is what they're doing this is what they're feeling this is what they're thinking this is what they're planning to do and they would also capture things like oh and this was really funny and everybody would like oh that that one has the hearts for that one you know that kind of thing you know whenever it came to that like oh he has a crush on that one yeah and it's the fact that they could pick up on all these subtleties and the cultures are so incredibly different that technology and everything to me that gets at the core of what makes us uniquely human is that we H we we can read each other no matter what culture we're in so that's that's what I wanted to share and I just love to hear what others have to say and what you have to say about that too ector of course yes I'm going to tell you and then I think Jeff will will complement because he knows a lot about science fiction he's the the genuine article but what you said is very interesting because I I've been thinking a lot I mean for instance I I read the three Loi the three body problem I'm really excited about those books and amazing also and they have a lot of common and something I reflected a lot is what is so enticing about the expanse it is not the story is it is not the the prot molecule is not going to other planets this is exciting but what really makes it extraordinary is that you understand these humans no matter how advanced they are no matter whether they go to through the ring or not what makes them take are human emotions and love and fear so it's it goes to the basic like you said with with with those guys that wanted to watch everything and they understood perfectly because it all boils down to our inner wantings and desires and this has not changed so it's not about technology or it's about humans what happen with human when they go to another place how do you start to colonize that place how they repeat the same mistakes and fights and struggles and what you find in the expand when they cross the ring the same problems that the first colonizers found when they went to America or whatever so it's all over the same things and maybe Jeff can tell us something about that um science fiction part but I believe that what makes this books of gripping is more human relationships and human con connection that science fiction itself yeah what do you think so um I think that from the perspective of agentic autonomy that is a key theme that cuts across science fiction and I think that is both the The Hope and the that we see in science fiction um I've been I've been a member of the libertarian fut future Society uh and on the best novel uh both uh best novel um voter and on the best novel committee uh for the last 17 years so I've I've really really been um very intimately involved with uh literature specifically pro pro uh Freedom science fiction uh for the better better part of my adult life and this is actually kind of what brought me to active inference and the active inference Institute um the idea of thinking through other minds and when you when you have a species they generally have many ways to synchronize especially like in a in a in a hive mind or with signaling they have a a a a much less uh friction inducing ways of signaling information I mean think about just cracking your cracking your window open when you go to sleep at night and hearing all of the nature outside and all of that information exchange that's going on that's being filtered and selected to the to the audience and um you know the billis and shovak and viser at all they um they tied this idea of thinking through other Minds to active inference about four or five years ago and and um in the textbook in in in the uh paral textbook um section 8.4 has a section on uh generalized synony and I think that's what we're talking about here and where I think we've gotten you know we got to a place back at the Bronze Age collapse um where we were living in these societies where I think we had this and they got too big they had this shared cognition and they got too big and I think that's part of what led to the bronze H collaps if you um if you agree at least with um goodness I forgot the name of the book um but yeah it was about the the Bronze Age collapse and um the think speaking of Science Fiction um Westworld was actually based around this book so um maybe in the notes maybe the comments here uh somebody can help us um but um my last thought is that um the invent the invention of Information Technology um oh it's a breakdown of Consciousness uh in the the origin of Consciousness and the breakdown of the bical mind that was the book um and um the creation of Information Technology and communication technology you know starting with the written word help us helped us to externalize our minds and that that still took took a very long amount of time um from the perspective of the Observer up until the digital Revolution and and now we are near real time ability to create this um shared cognition at scale across the boundaries of space and and that's really where I'm you know I'm I'm seeing with with the Advent of artificial intelligence and the the ability to have um these other agents that we're able to to interface with that do have a theory of mind measurably um um how how things are just accelerating so much [Music] faster what are you thinking being just curious um okay well first of all I feel like I got the privilege today to take notes like I usually watch our colleague Daniel taking all the time and just to be able to take notes instead of having to think about what I have to S out into the void is is quite the privilege um so here's what I'm thinking Hector H so just take this at face value I was thinking Interstellar Gladiators let me explain what that is that's me and and my kind of wayfinding view of the world uh I'm thinking about the Cinematic state of someone like Ridley Scott who directed the actual 1992 Gladiators movie uh with Abraham and and Frank or sa Cy right and I'm thinking that this comparative analysis which I could take place in my own way of looking at this um is in the context of viewing 13 television episodes so I haven't read any of the words in any of the nine books so that is giving me a different set of priers right and it took until 12 episodes 12 and 13 for me to get some semblance of what the big picture what's going on in this series actually is which was kind of cool because I used to send people out on wayf finding missions and they didn't know what they were doing until the end that there was there was a moment when it finally flicked in so that wasn't character development as much as viewer development so I actually kind of appreciate that so here's what here's what I'm what I'm picking up on today's conversation and and and just in general around this idea of interstellar Gladiators the crew of the Workhorse the Ross rosinante plus Miller is investigative Maximus Decimus Meridius aka the Spaniard in the are the main character in The Gladiator as strategic okay both cases are processing and addressing corruption as systematized starting with the regulatory capture in the case of the protogen and control of succession in the case of Commodus who's the the guy was supposed to be taking over for Marcus aelius information is asymmetry who knows about the protomolecule who doesn't as is political power asymmetry Commodus efforts to rest control away from a popular leader okay so how would we need to set the condition parameter the Gap in order for science fiction historical fiction fantasy to be equated with math art right the abstraction process is around problem solving and problem suspending problem representing to Hector's point about character movement are these science fiction historical fiction plus math art are they creativity as a generality I.E scale free free energy principle or creativity as types I.E C category Theory morphisms or both as Gladiators as orthogonal vectors I.E multipath Crossing processes minimum two within Chris Fields Wonder around what space is he described that at that topos Institute presentation as space's identity preservation enabling things like description then allowing for embedding then manipulating of objects now I'm summarizing what he said but that's in essence where where he thinks we're at in terms of understanding what space is in that case if I embedded science fiction and math art into a proximum relationship what manipulations would be necessary for those identities to be seen as both similar while maintaining the a TOA commute minimum identity meaning of each so ask the 13 episode rookie and just a couple of side comments about those 13 episodes I watched on TV inner thoughts passing through a space helmet is a real challenge for someone with my hearing loss at my age so the the people who put that series together need to understand that they might be cutting off a portion of Their audience because it's really hard to actually make sense because they're talking underwater all the time um and then the other thing is if you start with a book as your prior set you're going to be have a completely different set than if you're starting with scenes acted out so given my start with the TV series I didn't expect any book Secrets because I didn't have any B book Secrets as priors which I think kind of limits now I'm past the point of no return I'm 13 episodes in but I'm still curious how we take the math art of this because there obviously is and we combine that with the science fiction of it because I think they're similar but dramatically different so what say you anyone wants to um let's see um Bean could you comment on is that I'm trying to to see how we can connect the the comments you've made to what Jeff said about share cognition [Music] um can you like um like in in the context of the the uh objectives of the of my art like how do I I would like because I'm kind of a little bit lost as to the connections between okay so this is what I'm trying to figure out because yeah there's a lot of lot of back and forth here about character interaction right or or Theory through other minds and what I'm trying to do is Now understand how as people who are trying to bring an interactive space a parameterized space as a as a as a unit right as a as a way of of a unit of analysis math art how do we transfer or translate what we see as sort of the the basic human human interaction element into this abstracted space of math art so that people can carry out those kind of interactions in a way where they're not feeling like they're constantly branching off in directions and losing the thread that's what my question is that's really cool so so I mean that's a a scientific challenge that's enormous right that's why I asked it in the context of set the condition right because when what Jeff said and what Hector has pointed out in terms of the character development thing those things I think are perceived perceptually because we there's one and Hector you can tell me this because I don't know that I don't have the science to back this up but I believe that's one part of our brain that processes those types of interactions if we set a condition an abstracted condition that says one CH one side of this channel is math and the other side of this channel is Art now how do we in how do we using a different part of our brain interact it doesn't matter whether it's a movie about something that happened two Millennia ago or something that's going to happen two Millennia from now our brains are still going to have to try to come up with ways of making sense of that and have a coherency and that's why I'm asking this in the context of this math Arts Series yeah uh I I could try to give an answer to that even though not directly [Music] um I don't know if I can refer directly to math and art but I think I can connect this with active inference which it goes down to more or less the same uh in that what do you find with these guys that go to colonize other planets other a Universe um is that you still can connect with them no matter how advanced they are in terms of technology so there is something very basic related to human and a very slow timing of evolution that you don't lose and there are things that are happening there have to do with how we humans adapt which are very telling in term of movement for instance if you go to the belters you find something very remarkable these belters have been would say marginalized they are living outside in a very poor conditions um working very hard to provide with things to the to the planet Earth so they are mining and they're doing things for the Earth or for Mars if you will and because they have to live in this very um difficult condition where they don't have atmosphere they cannot breathe they are using this um how do you call that these space suits they have developed this ability to talk with their hands so they have developed a language of sorts that they share and I think this is also very interesting how again movement save the day this guy have developed something unique that is a new way of communicating gestural communication and I was discussing it with with Magdalena also this even gives them a sense of identity a very intimate connection with them and I think this is very interesting and tells you a lot about human nature how you adapt to different circumstances and conditions and how again movement is key so you've developed a way to produce new gestures that help you connect with others even if you cannot talk so there is a very raw basic way we have to adapt to colonized that is not so rational like Magdalena said that is very basic and that it comes up and I think this is something interesting in in this series how on the one hand you have very advanced technology on the other hand you have very basic human connections and it goes down again to the general synchrony that je referred to before you see how this small gestures this synchrony these pendulums of hens are so important to to I think this I don't know if I even answer your your question but but you have because I can piggy back on that now so in terms of math art if we agree that math solves problems yeah there there's a there's an element within this this fictional series now where there's a group of people all you know they have their goal their goal directed to problem solving and then there's the there's the people in the in the protogen now remember I'm only 13 episodes into this who are problem suspending and there's a whole bunch of characters now trying to keep the representation aspect of this to their own as asymmetric intentions and goals same thing happened in gladi and I don't need to sort of hold the two up but but my point is is that I think as as characters as human beings bounce off of those two things there is a tension and then and in the case of the television series and in the movie It's how well the directors and the and the you know the writers the screenplay writers are able to without without making it oh they bounced off the problem solution wall oh now we they just their bumper card just hit the problem suspension wall whatever whatever sort of dialogue comes out of that that's one of the things that people who step back and look at the math art as a as a place to let that tension play out and evolve is what I think is really interesting and it it's probably the reason why as I said said I do think it has a place if we want to look at through the math art lens one eye literally one eye open on the problem solving and one eye open on the problem representing and problem suspending but we won't I don't think we'll do that unless as a wayfinder we're asked to navigate with that particular lens explicitly so let me say something that maybe um a little bit uh extreme but I would say that I would not say that math is an Enterprise that fundamentally is designed to solve problems I think when we look at the history of math how it evolved in it emerged with the empires the Egyptian Empire Etc Roman Empire Etc when you look at that history math has emerged to solve technological problems that's the apply yeah but but what we have here is something that I want to go back to if we could which is Jeff mentioned General life synchron he mentioned share cognition and I'm I'm stuck with that right and I then I'm hearing you Dean and I'm hearing you say okay well we got this problem how do we parametri I don't know how to say that word how do we turn this into Mass right right now we can so the expanse in the expanse it's art right now in the context of solving problems that for humans are absolutely essential which is how do I survive how do we persist math doesn't show up at all because what's the what I saw in the expans is this riveting experience of going through life with these people in these environments who are trying to figure out all kinds of things that you know basically it's like the threat to their survival is in um daily it's a daily issue right um so under those conditions so I I I watched the the I watched the series seven times I had to watch it seven times because it the the levels the nuances the decision making the synchronization was just so beautiful and and so what the Insight I had was all of these micro movements and reactions and uh shared cognition builds so like in Little level layers like on a daily basis between these individuals establishing it's almost like you have to establish I don't even want to call it trust I think it I want to call it they have to establish hey how am I gonna read Dean how am I gonna read Jeff's when Jeff looks that way oh I wonder what that means and then finally I figure out that when Dean does ask oh yeah I know what he's thinking and then when Nector does okay okay so when I go in a room and we're we're we are facing a life and that's a decision we're able to make it we're able to make it and we're able to to survive and that's exactly what you see in these small scale societies is people know each other forever since CH since they're born and what they do is that they establish this library of information about each other about your each other's quirks about each other's talents uh weaknesses like you know in in the film in the expanse it becomes so clear when Naomi Nagata went through so much and then her trauma got to the point O overtook her her ability to be this amazing fighter and you see her fall apart Well everybody's aware of that you know James is aware of that Amos is aware of that and they're all dancing around to create this hive mind so that hey we can't lose Naomi right but wait I wasn't aware of that that I'm only 13 episodes in oh I I ruined that for you no no but but I want to make a point now because we do use math but we use it in ways that we probably probably aren't aware of it what you're describing I'm I'm fully in agreement with there's an accumulative aspect there's a there's an inductive piece to this which is undeniable there's also a decomposition piece as we start to shed things that we know we no longer have to pay attention to they're not part of arriving at a solution and so I think to I don't think it's a radical statement to say if you're focused on the inductive the accumulative piece but you also know that what you just stated is way past episode 13 I still have I still have more to do to get to understanding all I know about Naomi is she likes she likes Captain Holden and she really likes them okay that's as far along as the my mark blanket is allowed yeah so again choosing a math art perspective I'm not saying that it's it's the strategy to employ but what we've tried to do in this series is is hold up two things that seem to create a tension space for problem solving now how you choose to use that is up to you the strategies that that you employ are up to you I'm not arguing I'm not arguing against what you're saying all I'm all I'm suggesting at this point is if we want to pull it back to the math art piece I don't care whether we're talking something that happened 2,000 years ago or 200 years into the future there's going to be some thing that connects those two points on that Continuum it may not seem like they connect but I'm going to suggest that one of the ways that we can make that seemingly distal thing have a pairing is potentially through a math art lens not saying it's the only one but I think it's one that could be employed if you're struggling otherwise oh absolutely I think we have to use all the tools yeah yeah I I absolutely do it's just it's just for me and I think this is a really intriguing area I just I'm just curious Jeff what do you think about going back to your um generalized synchrony and share cognition ideas and thinking about this math our attention how does that fit into what you're thinking about these things I think the scale-free nature um the act of inference uh really comes to mind for me um you know when you when you train an AI agent you you're balancing exploration and exploitation um another way to look at that is how much do you want to diverge how much do you want to converge right Dean is shaking his head uh it's it's the wayfinding right if you stay in one place you're eventually going to run out of resources I I my mentor um Nick jacobe um he always references who Moved My Cheese if you've ever read that book um going kind of meta here you know as human being we have the unique ability to create conditions so that we have Surplus and in that in that explo in that exploration exploitation cycle we can seek things that are that are you know effective that embodiment um emotive um Beauty right so things that are beyond our base needs or even like you know uh maso's hierarchy and everything else right like I think and and the ab the fact that we have you know the ability to even have this conversation over the Internet like I was alluding to before um the fact that the the the authors uh were able to have the um the free energy to be able to create such a beautiful work of art right the way that we have been able to um create these these boundaries in these systems and these synthetic agents right like I'm thinking of companies and a film crew as synthetic agents with a shared cognition and a hive mind working towards an a desired end State and and I just see this happening more and more and more you know the more connected we become that's really cool that's really really cool so so going back to Dean I'm sorry I just or maybe ector what do you think it's like I think I could connect uh what all of you said um you were alluding to math and art um de and and Jeff about General synchrony and this High mind I think it all it's all connected because I'm just thinking in in chrisan hens when he he put these two pendulum clocks in a ship he put them in the same beam and they were not synchronized but because of the vibration they ended up perfectly in synchrony either um the same or but it was the they were synchronized they ended up synchronizing with each other and now Magdalena referred to something that is very relevant these guys were in the rosin an for a long time together this few people they have no intimacy they are seeing each other all the time they're seeing the micro suggestor the movements so they they end up knowing each other very well without even speaking and this is because of this synchrony so it's like the pendulums because they are in the rosinante is like being in the same beam they end up connecting they are synchronized and this is a Dan of shorts so this is math and is Art it's math because that is synchrony and is Art because it's like a dance is they are dancing together and they know how they each other how everybody dances so they can tell a lot just by the way they move so I think we've got this beautiful connection of movement of dence in in this ship and because of that you get to get more intimate with other people and you got this math because there is synchrony you have this art because there is and you have this deep connection that goes beyond talking or rationalizing and so I think it all kind of sort of connects in this way yeah you know it makes me think that it's almost to me like the math the math part of that we're talking about needs to dance with the art and not the other way around and and the and the reason why I said that is because I just you know I'm reading a book where this um these philosophers who are also mathematicians computer scientists are working on AI Etc and they are you know have a whole chapter on mathematical models and in that chapter they say flat out you cannot mathematically Model A non- erotic system so what do we see in the expans we see this story play out and what we see is this um oh I forgot the word that you guys Ed but let's see I I gen take autonomy I'm going to use that uh for a hive mind right so it's a hive mind and interacting with other Hive Minds uh even within the hive mind there moments where the hive mind Mark of blankets shift because people have differences of opinion or you know want to split and you know all all this whole dance is incredible but so when we're thinking about solving problems from and I just say anthropological perspective or it's just just a human perspective um what matters is being able to have the right ingredients the right you know combination of mental States um in that hive mind to have those ingredients to be right for that moment when the group is under risk of Extinction and so that's something that that's a non-erotic system they that's dealing with an environment all the time nobody knows what that challenge is going to be nobody knows when it's going to show up but it's that and that's what I find and I'm struggling with this and I have you know ni right you know I haven't talked to you but you guys I think every day about these question it's like eventually I would like to do an experiment eventually I want to turn this into real data that I can analyze with mathematical models but I I I honestly I can't yet because I don't really know what that what that's going to look like what kinds of decisions we will we have to make to say and accept Okay we're dealing with non-erotic systems so at some point we're going to have to say yeah we're going to have to use math we're going to have to make this freeze for a moment and the in these Excel data sheets and run these programs and so on and that's going to give us some answer that will be super useful but it's not it's not the the answers that really matter they're not the answers because and I'm saying this because I live in this tension in my academic world of you know grant writing Publications and everything it's like you need to come up with an answer that then we can use to apply everywhere else and I'm going how do we do that I I don't know if that's even possible okay so can can I just P you back on that one for one second and again we got dry space keeping the 90 minutes that these these live streams have have held to to your point uh megalina I think if you if you again if you think about the pattern pattern reasoning and you think about the Gladiator coming into the ring the Coliseum or whether you think about the characters who now have affiliated with the inner planets or the belters or the outer planets which are all again orbital Rings there's a there will come a point where no matter where what situation or context you find yourself under the to the to the point that has been brought to you magdalina you need to give me an answer okay Magdalena glad rator is different than Magdalen in interplanet affiliate sitting around a sitting around a un round table looking at orbits of different planets and asteroids and spaceships potentially colliding but but the fact that you have that ability to put yourself into each one of those different perspectives should tell you something that maybe there isn't a one only answer to this and whoever's asking for that one answer is look is asking the wrong question because they're they're basically locking you in to all conditions all settings all matters of of intention and priority which I think what this book series of books has shown me is that simply isn't the case right like this is a pretty this is a pretty you could hold this up as a pretty good piece of evidence that if you aren't able to as Jeff and you and Hector pointed out be adaptable that's the active inference piece of this if you can't actually understand what the the niche is feeding you back in terms of those particulars if if if it gets too General too quickly and those particulars aren't honored what are you coming up with I don't think you're coming up with anything other than triviality so I I think that that is important too when PE people say to you give me one answer to this um okay I always say well under under what circumstance and I think that's where the active inference really helps us you I don't think it's a get out of jail free card because there's lots and lots of times where gravity over here equals gravity over there but that but then there's also other elements to take into consideration too and then we have to decide how many of those other elements but I would never let somebody tell me I need a single answer to something that I know may not be have anything to do with today tomorrow or yesterday so I think we always have to be able to update and accept that that updating part of it I mean that's I think that's fair I mean people that want it to be absolute and certain probably aren't going to be really excited about active inference to begin with it's GNA come off better kind of threatening okay so really quickly uh you just you made me think of something that I think is kind of cool which is that um maybe if we could maybe there is no tension between math and art maybe art maybe math you know if you look at human history art is is a symbolic system it's a language right so in a way math it should be subsumed to Art and not the way around which is what people a lot of uh scientists are trying to to tell us to do which is the math comes first the art for don't even look at it it's completely irrelevant but I think what we're arriving at is the math comes first the the art comes first and the math is part of that art because the math is beautiful it lets us get at questions in a way that a pencil or a you know a dance doesn't let me do so I need the math as well so it's it's like adding to the choreography in a really fascinating way to our human experience as opposed to doing this dance which is so suffocating and and I love that about the active inflence Institute and that's why you know I'm part of it is is that yeah art is super important in what we're doing and so I think this is a beautiful this was a beautiful conversation I love it yes you know what what reminds me this what you said now Magdalena uh between the distinction between math and art is this sentence that says how can you tell the dancer from the dance think that's beautiful you cannot separate the dancer from the dance if you take off the dancer there is no dance if you take off the dance there is no Daner and that's a beautiful analogy for Math and art I mean I think you cannot take one from the other would make no sense look at us converging on these things that's so fun so we'll follow up and thank you so much I don't know how do you end these live streams this is my first live stream ever thank we thank Hector for all the work put prepping and Je for uh helping us record this and Daniel for setting a low bar so we can meet it and Sh sh to leave yeah oh thank you all right awesome very well done thank you so much I'll see you soon we keep thank you bye bye bye
