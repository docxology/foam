# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The presentation discusses meta representations in consciousness, exploring their implementation and significance in neural networks and cognitive neuroscience.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Meta representations involve representations of processes rather than just states.
2. Higher-order theories of consciousness relate awareness to mental state representations.
3. Implementing meta representations in neural networks reveals vagueness in existing theories.
4. Confidence in metacognition contributes to understanding conscious experience and uncertainty.
5. The study proposes a meta encoder to represent neural networks and their functions.
6. Distinct meta representations for visual and auditory stimuli suggest different processing mechanisms.
7. The architecture allows for exploration of how consciousness may vary across modalities.
8. The potential functional role of meta representations includes qualitative assessments of experiences.
9. Future research aims to investigate meta representations' existence in biological brains.
10. The conference on consciousness is scheduled for July in Tokyo, emphasizing ongoing research.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Meta representations provide a framework for understanding consciousness and processing in neural networks.
2. Distinct processing for visual and auditory stimuli indicates different cognitive strategies.
3. Confidence and uncertainty play crucial roles in conscious experience.
4. Future research should explore the biological existence of meta representations.
5. Collaboration between neuroscience and AI can enhance understanding of consciousness.
