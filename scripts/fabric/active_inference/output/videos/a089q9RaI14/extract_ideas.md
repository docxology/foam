# IDEAS

- The active inference lab promotes participatory learning and application of active inference methods.
- The live stream discusses a paper evaluating active inference in multi-armed bandits.
- Participants in the stream include researchers with backgrounds in psychology, physics, and machine learning.
- The active inference approach connects decision-making, thermodynamics, and stochastic dynamics.
- The empirical evaluation focuses on multi-armed bandits, a resource allocation problem in cognitive neuroscience.
- Multi-armed bandits can be stationary (fixed reward probabilities) or dynamic (changing reward probabilities).
- Active inference can bridge cognitive neuroscience and machine learning applications.
- The discussion includes comparing action selection algorithms like Thompson sampling and Bayesian upper confidence bound.
- Action selection algorithms help determine which arm to pull in multi-armed bandit tasks.
- Active inference's expected free energy approach minimizes uncertainty in decision-making.
- Theoretical properties of algorithms include cumulative regret and efficiency in decision-making.
- Active inference may not always yield asymptotically efficient decision-making in stationary environments.
- Dynamic bandits require different approaches and adjustments to learning rules compared to stationary bandits.
- The exploration-exploitation trade-off is central to decision-making in active inference and multi-armed bandits.
- Future research may focus on learning parameters like lambda to optimize active inference performance.
- The potential for integrating active inference with real-world applications, such as marketing and finance, is significant.
- Open-source code and simulations for active inference provide opportunities for further exploration and learning.
- The comparison of active inference with traditional reinforcement learning highlights differences in uncertainty management and exploration strategies. 
- Researchers advocate for the use of parallel modeling processes to enhance understanding and improve decision-making in various contexts.
- The future of modeling may include combining different algorithms to leverage their strengths in decision-making scenarios.
