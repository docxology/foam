# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion explores hidden Markov models, active inference, and their applications in cognitive modeling and decision-making processes.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Weekly meetings focus on reading and discussing the active inference textbook chapters.
2. Chapter 7 covers exemplar discrete state space models and active inference methods.
3. Hidden Markov models are central to understanding belief and observation relationships.
4. Active inference models help in computational modeling and cognitive collaboration.
5. The musician example illustrates belief versus observation discrepancies in performance.
6. Free energy gradients are used to minimize prediction errors in active inference.
7. Learning in models can adjust parameters based on observed outcomes over time.
8. Active inference balances exploration and exploitation through expected free energy minimization.
9. Proprioceptive, interoceptive, and exteroceptive modalities are crucial for sensory processing.
10. Chapter 8 discusses continuous models and their relevance to robotics and active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding hidden Markov models is key for cognitive modeling in active inference.
2. Active inference helps bridge the gap between beliefs and observations in decision-making.
3. Learning processes adjust beliefs and improve model accuracy over time.
4. Free energy minimization is essential for optimizing predictive models and actions.
5. Exploring different sensory modalities enhances the complexity of active inference applications.
