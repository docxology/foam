- Free energy principle provides a framework explaining biological systems' survival amid unpredictable environmental fluctuations.  
- Predictive processing theory minimizes prediction error, optimizing environmental representations through generative models in the brain.  
- Markovian models serve as scientific models, scrutinizing their relationship with real-world target systems and consciousness.  
- Philosophical analysis of scientific models reveals their indirect representation of reality, influenced by human factors.  
- Markovian monism posits one fundamental entity, bridging gaps between mental and physical properties in consciousness.  
- The relationship between scientific models and reality is complex, requiring nuanced understanding beyond direct representation.  
- Free energy principle supports theories of consciousness, promoting dialogue between philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience.  
- Mathematical models in science offer representational insights, but do not necessarily dictate the nature of reality.  
- The intersection of science and philosophy fosters collaborative discourse, enriching understanding of consciousness and cognition.  
- Structural realism emphasizes relations over intrinsic nature, alleviating pressure of ontological commitments in scientific theories.  
- Philosophical frameworks can enhance scientific practice by providing cognitive models of representation and knowledge construction.  
- Markovian monism challenges dualistic perspectives by integrating internal and external representations within a unified framework.  
- Collective intentionality can be explored through free energy principles, fostering insights into social epistemology and knowledge.  
- The quest for metaphysical understanding in consciousness requires robust philosophical arguments and scientific collaboration.  
- Ongoing research in free energy principles illuminates the dynamic interplay between science, philosophy, and human cognition.
