# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter 4 discusses active inference, focusing on generative models, free energy minimization, and mathematical foundations for computational understanding.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Chapter 4 delves into mathematically intensive concepts of active inference and generative models.
2. Agents minimize free energy to reduce surprise through computations.
3. Jensen's inequality helps rewrite Bayes' theorem using logs for approximate distributions.
4. Free energy consists of Kullback-Leibler divergence and log model evidence.
5. Active inference introduces temporal dynamics through state transitions and actions.
6. Preferences influence expected free energy and planning within active inference models.
7. Markov blankets define statistical independence between agents and their environment.
8. Continuous and discrete time models are essential for understanding active inference.
9. Graphical notation aids in visualizing complex relationships in active inference models.
10. The chapter encourages further exploration of mathematical foundations and related resources.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding free energy is crucial for grasping active inference dynamics.
