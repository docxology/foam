# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Giovanni Rolla presents a paper on reconceiving rationality, proposing a view called radically inactive rationality that emphasizes contentless cognition.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Traditional rationality requires reasoning and formal benchmarks like logic or probability.
2. Radically inactive rationality emphasizes contentless forms of cognition through sensory-motor engagements.
3. Rationality is not merely defined by reasoning but involves proficient interactions with the environment.
4. Agency and autonomy are essential for defining rational actions in organisms.
5. Rationality can be understood as adaptive behavior in response to environmental challenges.
6. Predictive processing and radically inactive rationality can be reconciled through deflationary interpretations.
7. The myth of the given complicates the understanding of basic cognition and rational thought.
8. Content for cognition is socially and culturally embedded rather than solely individualistic.
9. Virtual reality poses unique challenges for understanding rationality and perceptual engagement.
10. Future research may explore the intersection of rationality, virtual reality, and ecological psychology.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Rationality involves a spectrum of adaptive behaviors, not just reasoning.
2. Understanding cognition requires integrating insights from ecological and embodied perspectives.
3. Agency is crucial for attributing rationality to an organism's actions.
4. Virtual reality complicates traditional notions of perception and rationality.
5. Future inquiries should focus on the relationship between technological embodiment and cognition.
