# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The introductory session of the course discusses active inference's relevance to social sciences, cognitive processes, and cultural dynamics.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The course focuses on active inference's application to social sciences and cognitive processes.
2. Key themes include complex systems, feedbacks, and cultural dynamics.
3. The teaching team comprises experts in cognitive science, ecology, and philosophy.
4. Cultural dynamics are explained through three broad categories: nomological, mechanical, and functional explanations.
5. Active inference posits that cognitive agents perceive the world through predictions and expectations.
6. Norms and values are embedded in cognitive processes rather than being abstract entities.
7. Cultural evolution influences how agents navigate their social landscapes.
8. Case studies illustrate the connection between active inference and societal phenomena like nationalism.
9. The course includes discussions on collective behavior, norms, and cultural scripts.
10. Future sessions aim to deepen understanding of active inference's implications for social science.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference is a framework for understanding cognition through predictions and expectations.
2. Norms and values significantly shape human behavior and social interactions.
3. The course encourages active engagement and feedback from participants.
4. Case studies provide real-world applications of theoretical concepts.
5. Understanding cultural dynamics is crucial for analyzing social systems and behaviors.
