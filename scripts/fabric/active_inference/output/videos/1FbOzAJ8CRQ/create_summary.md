# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Live Stream 19.0 discusses emotional valence, deep active inference, and their implications in decision-making and behavior.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The live stream introduces Active Inference Lab's discussions on applied active inference.
2. Emotional valence is formalized as a state of self based on estimated confidence.
3. Active inference models aim to be expressive, realistic, and interpretable.
4. The paper discusses connections between affect, cognition, and metacognition.
5. Affective charge is linked to agents' decision-making processes and predictions.
6. The simulation involves a rat navigating a T-maze to find food while avoiding shock.
7. Implicit metacognition influences an agent's ability to adapt to changing environments.
8. The model differentiates between emotional valence and the certainty of predictions.
9. Active inference provides a framework for understanding behavior through multiple layers of uncertainty.
10. Future research directions include exploring advanced simulations and their implications for psychology.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Emotional valence plays a crucial role in decision-making within active inference frameworks.
2. Implicit metacognition enhances an agent's adaptability in complex environments.
3. The integration of emotional and cognitive processes is vital for understanding behavior.
4. Advanced simulations can inform the development of more robust active inference models.
5. The relationship between affect and decision-making can influence both psychology and AI development.
