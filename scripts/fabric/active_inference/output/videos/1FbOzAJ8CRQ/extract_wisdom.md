# SUMMARY
Daniel, Stephen, and Blue discuss emotional valence and its connection to active inference in their live stream on April 1, 2021.

# IDEAS:
- Active inference connects learning and decision-making through emotional valence in computational models.
- Emotional valence can be formalized through fluctuations in estimated confidence in generative models.
- The imperative of active inference is to minimize divergence between observed and expected outcomes.
- Agents use hierarchical Bayesian networks to formalize emotional valence in their decision-making processes.
- Emotional states like anxiety arise from uncertainty in an agent's generative model.
- The active inference framework allows for the integration of affect, cognition, and environmental interaction.
- Implicit metacognition plays a role in optimizing action selection within active inference models.
- Affective charge represents changes in an agent's confidence related to their action model.
- The relationship between valence and decision-making is crucial for developing expressive active inference agents.
- The simulation of agents in T-mazes can illustrate behavior influenced by emotional valence.
- Active inference emphasizes subjective fitness over objective fitness in agent decision-making.
- The integration of affective states may improve the realism of computational models in psychology.
- Emotional experiences can be quantified through Bayesian models of inference and decision-making.
- The active inference framework is applicable across various fields, including ecology and psychology.
- Valence influences an agent's ability to adapt to changes in their environment through learning.
- The exploration-exploitation trade-off in active inference is informed by the precision of predictions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Emotional valence is fundamental in shaping decision-making and behavior within active inference models.
