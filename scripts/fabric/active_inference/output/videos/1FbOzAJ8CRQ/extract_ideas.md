- Active Inference Lab is a participatory online platform for learning and practicing applied active inference.
- The live stream aims to introduce and discuss concepts related to active inference and its applications.
- The paper discussed is titled "Deeply Felt Affect: The Emergence of Valence in Deep Active Inference."
- The goal of the live stream is to provide context for upcoming discussions on active inference.
- Hierarchical deep Bayesian networks can provide a principled formulation of emotional valence.
- Emotional valence is hypothesized to be formalized as a state of self based on confidence fluctuations.
- The paper seeks to connect decision-making aspects of agents to emotional balance through active inference.
- Key questions include how to create expressive and interpretable active inference models for realistic agents.
- Active inference formalizes survival and procreation through minimizing divergence between expected and observed outcomes.
- The relationship between implicit metacognition and affect is explored in the context of active inference.
- Active inference provides a framework for integrating body, mind, and environment in understanding cognition.
- Emotional valence is recognized as fundamental to adaptive behavior, yet its origin remains elusive.
- The paper develops a Bayesian model of emotional valence based on precision of action models.
- Maintaining internal valence representations allows agents to optimize confidence in action selection.
- Affective charge tracks changes in fitness estimates, linking affect to mental action and metacognition.
- The simulation of agents in a T-maze illustrates the dynamics of decision-making and learning.
- Affective inference helps characterize how biological systems can infer their affective states.
- The study emphasizes the importance of integrating affective states into computational models of decision-making.
- The relationship between anxiety, valence, and decision-making is explored through simulations.
- The model simulates adaptive behavior in agents facing changing environmental cues.
- Higher-level contextual and affective states enhance the adaptability of agents in decision-making scenarios.
- The implications of active inference extend to computational psychiatry and robotics.
