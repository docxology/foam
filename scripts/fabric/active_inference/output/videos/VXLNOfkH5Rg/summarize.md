# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Lab livestream discusses Matthew Sims' paper on biological minds, active inference, and reciprocal multi-scale integration.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Lab promotes participatory online discussions on active inference and related topics.
2. Matthew Sims' paper focuses on counting biological minds and their integration.
3. Participants explore the connection between cognition, agency, and autonomy.
4. Discussion questions address the roles of priors and agency in autonomous action.
5. Collective interactions can lead to shorter planning horizons for adaptive systems.
6. Memory plays a crucial role in shaping generative models and action policies.
7. The relationship between consciousness and planning time is examined.
8. Affordances influence cognitive processes and memory recall in various contexts.
9. The potential for technology to impact literacy and memory skills is debated.
10. Future discussions will continue exploring concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and biology.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Collective interactions can enhance adaptive decision-making and planning.
2. Memory is integral to generative models and affects cognitive flexibility.
3. The interplay between consciousness and planning is complex and nuanced.
4. Technological advancements may influence traditional literacy and memory skills.
5. Active inference provides a framework for understanding cognition across systems.
