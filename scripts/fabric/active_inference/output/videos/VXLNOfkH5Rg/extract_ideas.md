# IDEAS

- Active Lab is hosting a live stream discussion on Matthew Sims' paper about biological minds.
- The lab promotes participatory learning and applied active inference practices.
- Each Tuesday features a group discussion on a research paper, with guest streams on various topics.
- Participants share their backgrounds and interests in relation to the discussed paper.
- The conversation centers on folk psychology, folk biology, and how they relate to phenomenology.
- Multiple disciplines contribute to the discussion on biological minds and active inference.
- The mundaneness of experience parallels the concept of baseline weather.
- The psychological modeling in folk psychology influences understanding of agency and autonomy.
- The connection between cognition, agency, and autonomy is explored through a three-dimensional framework.
- The role of defined priors in autonomous agents is debated.
- The importance of non-equilibrium steady states in cognitive processes is emphasized.
- The relationship between active inference and thermodynamics is explored in the context of cognition.
- The discussion involves the implications of energy use in biological systems and their adaptations.
- The concept of agency in non-living entities, like lightning bolts, raises philosophical questions.
- The influence of cognitive processes on behavior and decision-making is examined.
- The potential for collective agency and shared cognition in social organisms is highlighted.
- Discussions about the future of consciousness and the role of memory in generative models.
- The relationship between memory and action policies is essential for understanding cognition.
- The distinction between mere active inference and adaptive active inference is significant for understanding biological systems.
- The potential for memory palaces as a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities is discussed.
- The implications of technology on literacy and cognitive skills are explored.
- The importance of grounding memories in physical infrastructure is emphasized.
- Future discussions will focus on non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology.
