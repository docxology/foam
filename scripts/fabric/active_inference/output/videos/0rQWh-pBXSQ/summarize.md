# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Andrew discusses his tutorial on active inference and multi-agent modeling presented at the International Conference on Computational Social Science.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Andrew presented a tutorial at the University of Pennsylvania on active inference.
2. The tutorial aimed to teach coding and develop resources for others at the Institute.
3. Active inference relates to agent-based modeling in computational social science.
4. The tutorial focused on multi-agent simulations to explore collective problem-solving.
5. Participants were encouraged to develop agents that learn and adapt in simulations.
6. The tutorial emphasized realistic assumptions and reproducibility in modeling.
7. Active inference agents are designed to make autonomous decisions based on beliefs.
8. Andrew highlighted the differences between active inference and traditional reinforcement learning.
9. The tutorial included practical coding examples and resources for further learning.
10. A collaborative approach in modeling can foster better learning outcomes in education.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference offers a framework for more realistic agent-based modeling.
2. Collective problem-solving paradigms can enhance educational practices and learning.
3. Emphasizing assumptions and reproducibility is crucial in simulation modeling.
4. Collaboration among agents can lead to both positive and negative learning outcomes.
5. Further exploration of active inference can bridge gaps in computational social science.
