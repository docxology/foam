# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The live stream discusses the free energy principle and active inference, contextualizing the paper "A Tale of Two Densities".

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference live stream 6.0 was hosted by Daniel Friedman on October 9, 2020.
2. The stream aims to contextualize the paper "A Tale of Two Densities" by Ramstead et al.
3. Active inference relates agents and the world using the free energy principle and generative models.
4. The discussion includes a contrast between Bayesian and inactivist models in understanding cognition.
5. Generative models are proposed as embodied and enacted, not merely structural representations.
6. The paper critiques structural representationalism for overlooking action in adaptive behavior.
7. Active inference emphasizes the importance of perception-action loops in agent-environment dynamics.
8. The stream prepares for a follow-up discussion on the paper scheduled for October 13, 2020.
9. The philosophy of science distinctions between principles, theories, and hypotheses are explored.
10. Feedback and questions from participants are encouraged to improve future discussions.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference integrates ideas from Bayesian models and inactivism to understand cognition.
2. Generative models should be viewed as active controls rather than static representations.
3. The free energy principle serves as a foundational framework for active inference.
4. Different philosophical perspectives impact the interpretation of cognitive models and theories.
5. Engaging in collaborative discussions enhances understanding of complex scientific topics.
