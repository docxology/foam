# IDEAS

- The live stream focuses on contextualizing the paper "A Tale of Two Densities."
- Active inference relates to agents' interaction with the world through the free energy principle.
- The stream aims to prepare for the upcoming discussion about the paper on active inference.
- Free energy principle explores the relationship between agents and their environments.
- Different interpretations of models include structural representationalism and inactivism.
- Structural representationalism emphasizes structures, while inactivism focuses on action and ecological perspectives.
- Generative models are seen as policy selectors rather than mere structures in active inference.
- Bayesian models can represent complex systems and update beliefs based on sensory data.
- Active inference links sensory input and action selection, emphasizing embodied experience.
- The philosophy of science distinguishes between principles, theories, and hypotheses regarding active inference.
- The free energy principle is a normative framework that cannot be falsified like specific theories can.
- Active inference serves as a process theory about how agents adaptively interact with their environments.
- Inactivism critiques structural representationalism by emphasizing the importance of action in understanding cognition.
- The generative model in active inference is enacted through action and embodied activities.
- The stream encourages interdisciplinary engagement across fields like ecology, psychology, and cybernetics.
- Future discussions aim to clarify the implications of active inference on cognitive neuroscience and modeling.
