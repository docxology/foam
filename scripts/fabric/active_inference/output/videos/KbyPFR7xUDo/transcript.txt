[Music] all right hello everyone welcome to actinflab livestream number 39.2 it's march 9th 2022 welcome to the actin flap we're a participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us at the links here on the slide this is recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so we can improve on our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams check out activeinference.org to learn more about anything that the lab is up to today in stream number 39.2 we're in our third discussion around this paper morphogenesis as bayesian inference a variational approach to pattern formation control in complex biological systems by franz kuchling who's here with us as well as fristen gyorgev and levin so we're gonna have a fun discussion in the dot two the dot zero was some background and context hopefully overviewing the paper the dot one we had a discussion that opened up several threads and today we will in the dot two say hello on the introductions and then just jump in to a blank slide or to a not blank slide so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in california and i'll pass it to dean good morning i'm dean i'm in calgary and i am going to say that i have one thing i want to look at down the road which is how long is a person a stem cell which i think this paper might help us parse a little bit and i'll pass it down to blue hi i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico and i also similar to dean have questions about um when a cell becomes a cancer cell and like how does it develop its own generative model and just in general like when you're looking at complex systems how these small perturbations can lead to like a totally different effect downstream which i think is kind of related to the stem cell question that dean has and i'll pass it over to the first author events hi i'm france um i am a phd student in the 11th lab in tufts near boston and yeah i study part of active influence in my theoretical work and i do a lot of experimental work as well looking at information processing and organisms and cells oh so where does stemness or how do stem cells play into this paper and this line of research france definitely something we've touched on but just to kind of start generally and then we'll zoom in somewhere so take it away sure um the the idea is that the the cells initially when they're in the simulation when they're being initialized they have um the random emulation initialized and they have very low beliefs about what cell type they are they can be one of four different cell types in this particular simulation and they all share a a model a morphology they could achieve that they essentially are programmed to achieve at some point but none of the cells are any of the given cell types initially at least not with any um significant precision um and as they move along signaling to each other and sensing each other and secreting signal types in response to each other they then slowly by slowly infer a cell type which essentially is differentiation so cells starting with low precision about what kind of cell they believe themselves to be and then there's a process of differentiation so dean or blue any thoughts on that sort of stem to differentiated uh continuum and i'll pull up an image from a non-active perspective that also shows that kind of a continuum so i have just something to add that's ties into the paper where there's aberrant signaling so a stem cell differentiates but then during the process of carcinogenesis like retains some kind of or or d differentiates into something that's more similar to a stem cell than it is to a different kind of cell and so this plasticity is important to retain like so that we can repair ourselves but also it can lead to kind of a an aberrant signaling pattern yep like this uh notion of having a terminal cell revert to a state and regain the ability of having stemness is one of the characteristics of cancer because it can then sometimes differentiate into other cell types that are like normal and downstream of a precursor or abnormal in some other way how is also something i was going to say it's not something that happens and especially in higher organisms right not not every organisms keeps absolute stem cells in all kinds of populations one example that i used to work on is an uh and zebra fish where you have an always developing eye and there's certain um they're parts of the retina essentially that can be differentiate some extents they're not entirely stem cells they have a stem cell niche as well but there's also especially they know also in higher organisms while they keep those populations of either stem cells or of um already partially differentiated cells that can be differentiate so it's an important um part regeneration um and ironically this is something that's not been studied for 401 of this there's some older research that was done where a highly highly regenerative organisms when they undergo um they did this in salamanders and they injected them with carcinogens and they basically had it um you know saw a tumor progressing and then they cut up a lymph in these elements of highly regenerating it would actually renormalize um the the tumors essentially so initiation of regeneration and those organisms seems to actually counteract um cancer progression and even kind of remove the tumors which is very interesting and it kind of this feeds a little bit into the idea in this paper as well that regeneration right what what happens is you suddenly now have a much higher flow of information on things to rearrange to to redifferentiate and and that is kind of like what i was thinking as well with the simulation here of the the the cancer rescue phenomena where you you get you rescue this um this formation of aberrancy abram cells and iron signaling by having a strong contact um between cells as well nothing i'm modeling generation here although you can i think in the original paper carl has done some way to cut i think part off and let it let it grow again i think that has been done in the original paper and knowing one's place um but that's something to kind of keep in mind this is something that that is experimentally highly studied um to an extent so one general note and then a question this question this idea that the organisms that have the highly regenerative capacity and there's a continuum from regrowing just the tail to regrowing a whole limb to kind of an extreme or a highly um regenerative case like the planaria that was studied in this paper so it's all kind of on a continuum from total ability to regenerate from any adult somatic cell can fully recapitulate the full population all the way to a total opposite of that and then you pointed out that it might be related to cancer progressions and phenotype and that speaks to what blue brought up about the um [Music] like system level effects there's the individual cell and there's the system level because clearly there's something about the system level in the regenerative situation that would lead to this being different or maybe it could be explained by just something internal to the model anyways um you mentioned that higher information was associated with rearrangement could you explain a little bit about that or how does it play out in this paper or in general yeah it's basically the um the idea that and it's not not so much the the total information content but the flow of it and we talked a little bit about this last time right it's hard to really kind of quantify this in a in a more meaningful biological sense but the idea is that it's it's information flow like i think um dean asks a question like i said is more information always good and my kind of answer to that was it's it's it's within context of what the what the participating autism can receive and can process so in the sense that if you have you know cells that you know is processing certain information with a certain kind of rates time constants then kind of getting information in within with that time frame in mind is what what makes it more likely for them to kind of understand better their environment and react to it as opposed to a cell you kind of think of it also cancer cells um that you know have the whole sensory part completely perturbed that do not react to the environment anymore then everything else becomes noise and it gets ignored um that's kind of the idea so there is there is a lot of different differences in of how the cancer cells because they have changed ion profile iron channel profiles have changed uh machinery of what they're actually transcribing so all of that leads to the difference in how signals are being processed and understanding that and then reacting to that is i think is a key to to understand and treating this disease awesome thanks dean i don't know if i have the answer to my my question um which which is how long is a person a a in finger and scare quotes a stem cell but one of the things you mentioned bronze in the point one was i think steven asked the question about how much volume or in the flow and what i've heard you say back was um it's always a state space dependency which which i when i'm reading the paper was i think you made a really good sound um case for that but then one of the things that when you had to when you had to sign off one of the questions that i brought up hopefully that maybe we can discuss a little bit today is like in figure four and five um of the paper all that black area around when the sort of cells move into into place and that's a crude way of describing what's going on there but all that black area around that am i is it fair to say that that's kind of the the state space dependency or is that just assumed and how would we because daniel did a good job of sort of saying there's some invisibility aspects to this when we mult do multiple layering and so how how do you give people a sense of what's going on in that in that black that blacked out area right i think i think black is a good a good color representation because it's not really a color i don't think but it but it kind of speaks to this idea that um we've got these low beliefs but how long for how long as a person or as cells as a cluster of cells is that beneficial right when we're talking we're talking of course here on under the the big umbrella of morphology so that was kind of where i was wondering today maybe you could you could explain it because you the focus the eye tends to focus on the object within the frame as opposed to sort of the area around the what we would consider to be the object so maybe you can kind of help me understand this state state-space dependency piece yeah i mean so um if if you have a look at figure two so and um what i didn't plot in the in the in the figure four and five and two i did is the backup concentrations right so there are of course some some levels of cons of signaling uh molecules in the background as well um which will also of course be the case in the in the actual simulations um down the line four and five um the the blackness so the one interesting part about this simulation which was done mainly for simplicity and lack of necessity is to not actually have an external environment per se like there's nothing right there's no external force like outside of base everything in the simulations is done by the cells where the cells they make the environment right so essentially there's an external environment by the signaling molecules that they put out but we don't have any external um limited like limits around it we just basically that's the space we plot um the signaling molecules don't go farther than that um and there isn't any external force um which we could do right we the power simulations we do this asymmetry we essentially get uh we get sort of an implicit environment by changing the response to the signals around each other you can imagine that you put something in the medium that that flips how how old signaling is being processed and that's it um so back to your question so this about this blackness um and when is that beneficial if i said that question correctly it's there is of course like a hype like a precision component to it and kind of more less hand less hand wavy if uh you know if your environment is very volatile and constantly changes and you keep right you have a not not this essentially it's a closed system right if you had an open system right you constantly would get signals also from the environment this will also become all a lot messier and especially initially right in the in the first frames of that figure um four and five where we get the simulations they all start together i mentioned last time there are certain smoothness requirements where like if we had to put this dampening on the sensitivity a long time so inverse dampening it will get more sensitive with time but just because initially they're very unstructured they have you know very low prior beliefs and they will jump crazy if they have high sensitive to each other because they're in such close proximity and um that is something that we of course do see in biology right we do be most um especially the higher organisms right they start often usually in close environments now of course you can you can argue this you don't need to go to any information stuff you can argue well it's just you know thermally insulated they have their own food supplies it makes you know just makes like a more safe zone like just physically energy speaking but i do think there's a big component to it it's like shutting this highly volatile you know it's self-inferring organism off from influence to an environment at a stage when all these cells are figuring out what to do each other so they need they kind of need to have a kind of a barrier between signals from the environments which normally you know to us adults between a mature organism are not really dangerous by 2n developing organism full of stem cells can be problematic and will basically would um perturb its natural kind of progression in this states based on this sulfate acquisition there is a cool paper i can reference to you from chris fields who i am from disclosure i'm working with and very much admire him who wrote my paper about motor solarity as exactly the consequence of what i'm talking what i just said the multicellularity basically emerging in a as a way to shut some cells or you know cells that are in an initial region of motility it's also undergoing an evolution towards complexity needing some kind of barrier from the environment basically making themselves making creating a market bank around them that makes it so they're not constantly you know being perturbed by the environment and that's the idea of of how my motorcycle to emotion in the first place is to insulate niches which will become stem cell natures from the environment so that cells that are undergoing you know very much very dynamic changes in short amount of time um that therefore need to be kind of sensitive to the environment cannot be need to be isolated from influence from the environment that would perturb this careful um inference of cell type thanks dean yeah so in this in this figure too you can see that there's we're talking about ranges because we've got values on the horizontal and the vertical um sides of the box so so one of the things that i think is really interesting is that once you so you we've all spelled it out if we're dealing with active inference we want to avoid something surprising right the whole the whole uh variational aspect of this so again if we're talking about going from something that is has low beliefs to something that gains in in i'll say gains and sensitivity without hopefully killing what i want to say next if if it's about signal adaptation to these top-down conditions which influence the final form taken is there some way based on what you researched with this paper is there some way to know as you're approaching that place of energy exhaustion like is there something that the cell tells you that it's it's finding this too surprising because one of the things we again we talked about was that rate of change being so rapid say like the u.n report on global warming where we simply don't have the machinery to be able to adapt is there something that you found out through this paper that kind of said to you as you were looking at these things oh wait a second here we're just gonna we're gonna we're not our intent is not to kill this thing off but we're approaching that place where the environment is just too changing too fast yeah i'm trying to give you a more detangling hand waviness but um let's start with the general answer first so um yes you do it's you can of course you can like one way you can quickly see it isn't that kind of like something that you get with the picture and error plot um that you all skip with the free energy plot if you um right in a perfect world you will get like a nice move like you know exponential decay of the free energy function um if that keeps changing bouncing up and down um that will be very problematic i i did some simulations afterward to not include in this paper but based on exactly the same stuff um where i was including a time ver um based on top of this time sensitivity um you know increase so um that i use for basically you know i'm increasing the sensitivity over the time but having a low in the beginning on top of that i put in a an impulsive like a sinusoidal or a rectangular function which was um we were just trying to simulate what i'm doing in my in my experiments in a lab where basically you know pulse certain signaling inputs to my organisms i wanted to see basically if i randomized that or made that in a certain certain pattern how well would the simulation still be able to cope with that and uh and in the case where i had like a nice regular pattern of that um you in the in the free energy lan and the free energy decay you hardly saw that you know initially like initially even minute since it was very high it was you know you couldn't see it there there was like a big jumpiness and fuzziness you could see it also in the in the belief updates uh you know basically they were um they kind of emerged kind of like um they diverged initially very strongly and that diverged in terms of their beliefs um that they had about themselves but then kind of afterwards the um when the sensitivity overall was kind of um acclimating but was kind of varying around this acclimation point you didn't see that much anymore in the um in the in the in the regular pattern but when the ones were less regular um that was very much perturbed and the and the fan energy also didn't actually quite uh did not only did it not um come to kind of like uh to this asymptotic behavior but it actually started increasing again basically um just was really perturbed and you didn't see that so john's a question like um how do you see if if you are not adapting correctly even though you don't actually know yet what the what your external status i would answer it's how much are you switching back and forth between your beliefs and uh i guess more precisely also like how certain are you of that right this is something that we talk about in medical immersion which i've recently from the last people i've been getting into and reading about metacognition and rats and primates and other animals saying the first step to metacognition is as far as i understand it is having a certain confidence about your results with rats where they basically gave rats the option in this kind of cognitive task um that they could also just not answer the task not to not not push the level because i think it was leverage um i think what the task was but it was based levers and they had an option to not push a lever for which they will get a lower reward than if they um a much lower award than if they got it correctly but more than if they got it wrongly and so what they saw is that they actually would in certain certain cases when you know when they hadn't learned it when they hadn't learned the task correctly they would just not push the lever and that is used as like a first instance off of the medical cognition a sense of they must have been unsure about what you do and then chose not to do it so i think that's kind of like if you it's one thing if you kind of lean back and forth because you always think well you know i'm this and that um being unsure is normal but kind of uh kind of uh constantly going back and forth between certain states of shortness is also problematic so that's the generalized answer to this um yeah i think i think the interesting thing there is the emphasis on the back and forth metaphorically speaking we tend to uh give a lot of attention over to the balance piece but what what you're talking about when you're talking about the environment is not the plank as much as a moving fulcrum so how do you how do you adjust right the balance i guess is the is the outcome but it's the uh the process itself is the back and forth so yeah i i wondered about that because some things you do want and from like from an epigenetic standpoint you do want certain cells to die you want their energy to expire absolutely right that's part of the back and forth as opposed to the balance you know there's no balance metaphor you want there you want them to die yeah and they're not dying so that's really interesting thank you now i wanted to add one one more kind of attempt to answer more specifically is there's a paper by uh i'm probably pronouncing this name wrong drawfully which was um just google valence and uh active inference um they basically looked at you know valence in terms of like um judging if your actions are you know certain like are they better or worse basically is that um are you you'd be assigning a a sign positive or negative two to outcomes um and they were doing that uh in the active infant schemes and they were defining it and you know there's other definitions i'm not everyone was going to be about this but they were looking at it in an infant scheme about the rate of change they were looking at the first and second order derivatives um of um how i'm saying this correctly um about how the prior beliefs were updated to the position that how how important like how how sure they were about what cell type there were and so basically in the segment order derivative basically how much would they change at any given time in their beliefs that's what they um what they plugged in valence into different mode it gets more complex than that but that's the gist of it so um that i think is a in the within the frame of active inference is a more specific answer your question is look at the the rate of change by which your beliefs are updating and that with respect to your uncertainty of course um there's this whole um cause i've written about this as well um i'm very interested as well from the browse standpoint of you is that stress stress sensing mechanisms like stress is a universal um driver um in biology it's actually much more important than rewards i kind of find that we are talking about rewards but um biology is much more focused on on stress um because it's more informative and it's more important to deal with than than what maximizing but of course you always say it's just a negative but the the point that being is uh stress as in terms of for uncertainty like not having not minimizing your energy effectively and stably um that will lead to stress and there's paper that doesn't humans i think i mentioned the last time as well what they do experiments with humans and mice as well were they very ethical where they shocked um they give the electric shocks i think they're both mice and humans um and then they showed that the level so they were more stressed out not just by this like the sharks themselves but they couldn't predict um the electric shocks so it's that uncertainty of what coming next i think that is the most if i had to like say one thing that is most negative of uh of you're going in a bad place so if you are stressed because you have no idea what's happening and you cannot even if you know something that's going to happen you know when it's happening that's a lot less bad than if you don't know at all um one last really dark example to really make this a dark place is there is a i'm from um i was born east germany um i guess i was only when you open the wall fell so um but we you know my parents were very much and there was uh this um now it's a museum but it was a prison for the the basically political detainees in east germany and east berlin and we went there as a class once and um they showed us all the things all the techniques they used to interrogate um prisoners including torture and one of the torture devices um was i believe a japanese device where you would get you put your head down on this device and there's a water that's dropping from the top onto your neck so you think at this point like uh it doesn't sound too bad right the problem was is that the drops you know there's um there's a lot of viscosity in there so um you know a lot of kind of fluctuations so the drops wouldn't always come at the same time and it kept repeating repelling um happening over time and time again so what the and the prisoners actually people that used to be in prison they were actually one was giving the tour so they were telling us yeah if you under the device after a couple hours or so these drops will feel like hammers on your on your neck and apparently a big component of that was the um not the the body not being able to adapt to it because you know the drops don't come at a perfect five second interval it happens kind of at some fast randomized um intervals so um that i think there's a huge part in and not just looking at stress over time but how you can adapt that stress and in order to adapt to stress adaptation to me always involves a component of prediction if you can't predict the source of the stress when it happens it makes things a lot worse this has been shown extensively in humans and also in in lower organisms and i believe um very strongly that there's something fundamental to any biological system to fundamental drive if you if you view if you you describe to the point of view that um minimizing uncertainty in the environment is a fundamental drive of life then with that you prescribe that minimizing stress and the source of stress over time and being able to predict it is also fundamental and lacto of makes a very dangerous system blue thanks so all that's super interesting um just okay so let me i'm going to start at the front and work backwards so in terms of uncertainty and um how that's what causes stress uh i'm really kind of i don't know reluctant to use the word stress in a biological system like i think about stressing a biological system is like pushing it out of equilibrium um but but maybe that's just a stimulus right like i want you to rebalance and go to like a new equilibrium like or like turn on heat shock protein or you know there's a variety of different things like many ways you can view stress as a stimulus to do something new or to perturb the system in a new way um but but in terms of uncertainty i think that there's a lot of truth in um how uncomfortable people are with uncertainty like at a cognitive level and you can even see it like in the stock market before like the election is in before the election results like the stock market goes crazy and because nobody knows i mean it's not that one candidate is preferable over the other but it's just the unknowing is very um like people freak out so so and that speaks i think to metacognition also um and then so i i wanted to back up a little bit if i can um to your discussion of information flow and how that might be difficult to quantify and daniel i don't know can you flip to the section for me please on um the generalized flow section i think we started to get into that a little bit last week and we did discuss it in the dot zero but i have like i i know that this is very um mathematically technical and so i just have a little bit of of questions about um this and maybe you can help explain it in a way that's perhaps less technical but specifically information flow and chris fields is coming uh to discuss the fep for generic quantum systems next week and so i can i can similarly interrogate him about about some of this stuff uh and i'm looking forward to it but um you know we have a discussion there's a discussion in the paper about the probability flow um and information like a probability current i think is actually what is used and getting into information currents like if you look up what is an information current i think um there's like the idea of the von neumann information current and um that like is explicitly related to quantum systems so is there any similar like do we have a way to measure information current because even when mike came to the live stream and talked about um um expanding cognition biological cognition computational boundary of itself there was sorry um but when you expand biological cognition like there's you know you're basically expanding your informational awareness and so is there anything like an information current or how can you best relate that within a biological system is it like an expansion of your computational boundary or does it look like just more information goes in and comes out i think it's uh it depends on what depends on what level you're looking at i would say it's both um so the the the second part you mentioned that the information flow comes in and out that's something we just have more access to biologically speaking experimentally right um and you can absolutely you know you can you can look at you know you have all these uh sensors for for for sensors for receptors being activated for um genetic um transcription in response to that so so that's something that we can you have the best chance of quantifying experimentally and in terms of computationally it's something you can monitor and then also couple that with what chris fields um good thing you mentioned that because then i can relate to him that's basically what he's also very interested in right like how how does physical energy of course played all all into this with the mid and embarrassing metabolism right now this comes for free that's something that biologists often kind of um not broad it's actually no theoretical we're all just often kept under under the table because the idea is that energy is abundant and uh and in in life which is to extend true right there's plenty of sunlight there's plenty of things to spend food around um but at the same time locally just with entropy there is a strong competition there so just because you are living in a reservoir that has plenty of food and sunlight that doesn't mean that you locally are gonna gonna survive because of people locally competing with you the same is true right i mean uh this is always like when you talk to um when you talk to people that people that you know have problems the idea of um what why does entropy i don't want to say names but if you that's saying that entropy is always increased if chaos in the universe increases how do we see much more structure evolving and then um the of course the answer to that is that well just like in a path of water if you have certain oil droplets are going to come together because overall that makes that gives more degrees of freedom for all the water molecules so the entire entire system entropy did increase but you managed to find a solution that does increase that by locally creating more order that's the drive of um i think of life overall the quote that probably the talk that got me into biology is was from a biophysicist in heidelberg was saying life is not about energy it's for entropy um but the two come together right yes it's about how much information is available but then by extent of that once you are subscribed to that once you have to form these localized structures then energy becomes important again um so and that's what i think is needed right now when you have this high view highly spatially organized systems energy suddenly does become something that is valuable again um yeah i think i kind of lost my train of thought there um the the boundary yourself that's right your the other information flow that was the part about information but we can measure that um we have good ideas what was what's lacking is and uh quantum understanding of of how metabolism is really hooked into the information flow whether or not it's built into the model or whether it's ad hoc just down down the line you give it certain resources after a while it just exploits them the boundary itself is interesting because and of course in the cell we think well we have a you know there's a membrane the boundary of itself is very fairly obvious it's not as easy as that i think and of course if you look at two multicellular organisms it becomes um you know a tissue scale then that becomes a lot more difficult but even on a cellular level if you have certain receptors um you know you have certain activations of it then a modern energy generator of general monologues in the active inference scheme but especially an iterative stream you also have a model of yourself right and if at what point your own your own what you're what you're secreting your own your signals that you secrete also feedback into what you're sensing after all so it is kind of thought that that that whole system is very much perturbed in cancer cells as well where the how much like is it is are you actually receiving things from the environment are you basically just uh secreting and secreting and you don't really react to it anymore so the the boundary of self what what mike might already talked about this here will be have been much more than i can be about this but the idea is the boundary itself is encoded specifically with time and spatial constraints so like how much you're burning yourself what you want yourself might be more general about this yourself model depends very much on your sensual or your sensory memory like how how far do you sense and how and spatially how how much water can you sense and how much back do you have encoded as memory how much are effects in the past um um persisting so that you know so even though if you have a cell there's a certain membrane if if that cell does not actually keep any track if that cell is not somehow a sensing or beyond a certain boundary and then it creates on boundary by these highly peripheral cells that are basically surrounding themselves with each other then suddenly the environment becomes mute um so the boundary of the self has essentially expanded i would argue um i think that's kind of the the thought train here i i'm just hope that was some way i would answer the question awesome blue so um just i was curious um you mentioned that there was a talk that um got you hooked into biology was it eric smith and his discussion of biology and entropy because that's also fabulous it was not i'm real just saying that was um damn that's really embarrassing that the guy i don't remember right now the name of the person that got me into biologies ugh it's as i speak english right now it's all in german back then and always kind of my brain then has problems switching between those two and content as well as language um it'll come back to me probably within this talk eric smith does a wonderful job though of um you know discussing biology in terms of entropy and so if you are not familiar with this work i would just highly recommend it yeah that really reflects on our um discussion what parts of the self model are important to carry forward and then what are the affordances for direct and indirect self-modification so that's one piece like you mentioned the autocrine signaling and that's not even a contentious component it just is being modeled in a different way with active inference rather than just a molecular event that's happening that like cells secrete molecules that they also possess receptors to measure it's just putting that into a framework of reflexive self-modeling and stigmargy and niche modification here but just one other point that i thought was really maybe useful to highlight was this sensitivity and just like many of the terms in actin for kind of seeing that there is a narrow or a quantitative sense and then there's a broader sense because in any dynamical systems model you might hear about sensitivity of the parameter which is how much changing that parameter changes the outcome of the system and so that's a quantitative sense and then also it was brought up that it's important to model these like second order derivatives like how fast are things changing relative to expectations or how fast are they changing how they're changing and that is what the generalized flow is it's all those higher derivatives so we can use that quantitative sense of sensitivity to look at how parameter changes in the generalized coordinates of motion matter but also we can perhaps with cognitive modeling take this discussion of sensitivity in the way that people are usually meaning it like sensitivity of what is seen on someone's emotional state and then model that using cognitive parameters like valence and affect even though that's quite a disjoint use from the parameter sensitivity discussion on the generalized coordinates so it's was an awesome discussion with like what is stress and how does that relate to the parametric sort of neutral perspective on what stress or sensitivity what might mean just the model descriptive versus some of these functional or um phenomenological even ways that these terms come into play blue so that's super interesting thinking about uh sensitivity and stress in just in terms of cognition right like so i know like people that have sensory processing disorders get like super aggravated by something like a bright light or like a windy day um and just how how sensitivity does play into maybe the flow of of information like because you know i'm suddenly sensitive to this then i'm also sensitized to every other thing in my environment like someone's screaming over here and it's windy and it's hot and it's bright and then like i become just so over stimulated right like people have these these processing things and it's sensory is that something that like has momentum right like so you have enhanced sensitivity and does that just like then all of a sudden you're just you're so sensitive like we hear people say stuff like that like stop being so sensitive um just in terms of cognitive processing i thought that that was um just super interesting i think that's an excellent point i mean that's that's something that that that shows exactly how important it is for humans right you're gonna argue low levels as well um and in the evolution to be able to model our sensitive actually change our sensitivity right we would never be able to have conversations in our environments if we couldn't change consciously our and sometimes subconsciously as well our sensitivity parameters and um i think that's something also then also feeds into metacognition right you learn like oh well um i'm not paying attention enough so something to pay more attention to uh you're trying to tune this in and i think that's the in the sense of on the cellular level i think what where that feeds in is the is by learning over time right by how much being how many receptors are being activated how does that defeat in downstream then there is this component where essentially the the cell can upper sensitivity by expressing more receptors by if though if it's not understanding it's it's uh it's inputs it can increase those proteins they're responsible for sensing these things um and there's also different if you talk about ion channels specifically that we work with that there are different versions of iron channels that have different rate constants um the same is true for other um uh for for active proteins as well such as pumps so that becomes an a lot more you know explicitly um modulating sensitivity over time in a way to um to you know better react and cope with uh adapt to its environment again adaptation keep in mind involves prediction in most cases if not explicitly then basically awesome and by the way um then the guy is michael houseman and heidelberg before i turn around my grave oh that was the person coming to physics to biology biophysics cool um just to kind of connect that change in sensitivity to some of those mechanisms so if it's the sensitivity to a given hormone or a given circulating molecule then that sometimes gets accomplished biologically by changes in like the membrane receptor density or changes in downstream signaling pathways so even if the amount of receptor in the membrane stays constant it's like you can release more of the neurotransmitter in the synapse or you could have more or less receptors or you could have more or less of all these regulators and phosphorylating proteins etc in the downstream signaling pathways because there's a lot of complexity in that space but there's a lot of knobs including rates of change in rates of rates of change and lag effects with transcription factors and all this other basically any thing is possible and then at the organism level just to give one and then anyone else maybe at the some other level like it's kind of like a nest may ant being sensitive to interactions and then a nurse who's a younger aunt is like initially more susceptible or more sensitive due to multiple reasons like at the antenna at the brain in just spatially where the nurse is and then there's this um development towards being a forager being sensitive to forage or cues finding oneself in spaces where there are forage or cues that are useful so there's a lot of ways that these changes in the type of sensitivity again are already things that we talk about in developmental biology and so it's so cool to see how that is connected to the molecular mechanism the affective angle and then with the underpinning of the generalized flow yeah so you guys can push push back on this heart if you want but it's interesting i one of the terms that i coined was that stress programming or at least programming with stress assumed was basically learning either formally or informally that's what it is because there's a certain amount of stress involved be it positive or negative but i kind of threw that through that viewfinder i think it's interesting that back to the back and forth thing stress programming can be safer or it can be riskier and you know as long as it's not sort of killing the learner if safer in the sense of as intervention i think this paper showed that you can intervene but riskier is as distribution like sending something out into the unknown it can be safer as teaching or taught it can also be riskier as i'm teaching or untaught sort of just sort of throwing somebody into a situation and see whether they can paddle or not the last thing is it can also be seen as both modeling in the safer sense because we've reduced some of the variation or it can also be riskier as in terms of coordinating meaning the person has to kind of figure it out as they're flying the plane so i wonder what you guys think do you think that can we is there some agreement that learning in general be it formalized or informalized has has an aspect of stress programming that kind of is assumed or from my way out awesome question um blue or franz what do you think um i i don't think you're off it's this there's definitely of course you know that there's explicit uh incorporations of stress until learning but your question i think is like is it is kind of always simplicity there even if not explicitly so one one interesting kind of effect this blue mentioned earlier that stress you know can be interpreted as like human perceived stress hormones but it can also just be like perturbation from from equilibrium from homeostasis um and they actually do kind of this this has been breached this has been combined and homeostatic reinforcement learning where they kind of implicitly explicitly make the reward and reward based you know reinforcement learning about the homeostatic off point and then stress becomes suddenly a lot more explicit in that sense of perturbation from from your homostatic set point um in the in the active inference scheme stress is basically just your you could just define it basically as your you know your overall um difference and again like with those fans i was talking about like how much is your is your is your private belief certainty changing are you minimizing uncertainty um over time or not um it is it is hard i think it's hard it's hard both to completely uh say stress is not involved and without saying that while you're just calling everything stressed but it kind of it's really it depends on what how you define the stress but if you think if you go score something like as in like you stress as you're not right now in an energy minimized state you're not in a an active infant scheme or you're not in a  point in a more basic scheme then stress is i would argue you bring into some learning yes because without that if they don't have the difference to that if you don't actually if you don't have any drive to learn because you're not you know you think your everything is perfect then it's hard to to have learning so specifically if learning is about with the environment and context what is your why getting into your environment i trying to adapt to it as i try to learning in a sense of like adapt to it um and find a certain equilibrium with it then i think stress becomes very much explicit and it's ubiquitous in learning okay i just want to add one thing that's perfect because i always talk about the minimum of two and i think you i think you're absolutely right friends i think you have to then look at stress as being either voluntary or involuntary i think that's the minimum of two that you have to look at because i think if you have voluntary stress it's it's it's it's measurably different than the involuntary type so yeah you're right i don't think it's i don't think we can just throw under everything under one umbrella and make it a monolith i think we have to partition it right from the very get-go and say um all programming be it a curriculum whatever whatever the curriculum is that those stem cells have that's some of it's going to be voluntary and some of it's going to be involuntary based on the situation that they're they're placed in so again i wasn't trying to pull it in that direction but i didn't bring up stress but i really liked that it was brought up so okay yeah blue blue sorry so just um from a neuroscience perspective um it's interesting like the voluntary and involuntary stress thing is so different and i feel like maybe daniel will remember we discussed that at some point like when you're exposed to a stress that like you do to yourself on purpose like your strength training or something like that versus um you know some some externally imposed stress that you didn't volunteer for i think that that has a difference in affect i feel like we looked at a paper i can't remember off the top of my head though um but in terms of sensory processing it's really interesting in neuroscience we actually adapt right so so you can listen to like you this is a great example like you turn on the car radio and like you're listening jamming out in the car for i don't know a while 20 minutes 30 minutes and then suddenly it doesn't seem as loud and so you turn it up and then you're jamming out jamming out jumping out and still it doesn't seem as loud so you turn it up because the same level of stimulus produces a decreasing sensation um and that's true in terms of you know visual like when you first turn on the leg you're like oh it's so bright but then you adapt and so in in terms of sensory processing we have a mechanism for adaptation um and i i wonder about actually cells like not neurons because this is like i'm specifically talking about like a sensory processing way but i wonder if cells do the same thing i mean i guess like you know the receptor shuts or the receptors triggered and then it can't get activated again for some certain amount of time so even just receptor binding in and of itself is like an adaptation mechanism like you can't constantly like dump the chemical into the receptor open the channel or whatever like that's not like biochemically possible but but i wonder if um you know cells have some other adaptation mechanism outside of this um like channel opening or closing or just this is there more than like the mechanodynamics of the channel that um enables cellular adaptation um i i can think of a couple ones um but no one expert on this but um there's right you can think of first like on the episode on the epigenetic level if you basically just um you know recruit more histones basically have a more tightly packed chromosome you're gonna have less genetic expression no matter what kind of signaling input you get to the nucleus that's whenever i can think of it um another one is uh mechanically so the right lot most of the i hope i'm not over generalizing but i think most of the you know signaling against that receptors are sensing and then has to be transported to the nucleus somehow to to cause transcription that is usually directed right that has to correct up across cytoskeleton so if you change the mechanical properties of status skeleton itself um and uh not again yeah i'm out of my league but um that's something i could very well imagine um i want to ask someone that's my smile on that topic um lastly it's if you talk in in the intercell intercellular context then you know um things like uh you know what we and no in neuronal context you have these you know the synapses in the non-neural context you still have gap junctions and other complexes that basically allow transport between cells and those can also be modulated um by the cell so then there you can also get habituation and definitely no examples where people have shown habituation and uh even other um there's active research on on on showing that there's more just habituation but also actually the learning offer of a certain pattern as well i think that's true so i'm really interested in the cytoskeleton um because a lot of you know i mean the receptors are in the membrane embedded in the membrane but we don't really there's not a lot of work that looks at like the cytoskeletal dynamics with respect to um like modulation of receptor dynamics right right so like that's a field that i think or i haven't seen very much work um in terms of how does this the underlying cytoskeleton contribute to the properties of the membrane and how a cell might be behaving and just in terms of like you know things having to get into the nucleus i don't know i'm iffy on that one um i i think and it's just because i did very early work like transfecting cells in a variety of different ways and you know to get a gene into the into the cell to get the cell to express the gene you have to get it through the nucleus right how does it get into the nucleus like nobody can answer you so like if it doesn't have a nuclear target on it like how is it going so is it just like osmosing itself through or or like like just how is that exactly happening and so you call the vendor like oh i'm trying to use your product whether you're electroporating or you know using some kind of lipid mediated transduction they don't know they have no idea actually so it's just a super interesting um prospect and i think that in terms of both that and the cytoskeleton there's a lot of like dynamic remodeling that occurs during cell cycles right like during the phases you know like when a cell is dividing and growing and becoming two cells uh um there's and so like the nuclear membrane that's the point but in terms of terminally differentiated cells like a neuron or something that's not undergoing you know constant change in remodeling it's curious to see how that can happen um and i'm interested if anybody has any any good like hardcore mechanistic papers that you want to point out to me or or if anybody listening in the live stream wants to drop them in the youtube chat i would really love to take a look at them hill i really like dean returning to this uh idea that there's the there's a continuum or there's multiple archetype dimensions so not that it's all going to map on to just two but we know it's at least locally going to be at minimum two that there's the kind of uh one mode of interacting in an educational or training setting with a teaching and a taught that could still be in an interactionist or an instructionist way versus the unteaching and the untaught so that's the the difference between the athlete having their form like observed in a tight feedback versus when they're on a social away from that sort of a training context and so there's like an environment or there's a setting where there's some kind of stress as fundamental and then there's another type of environment where the different kind of stress is fundamental and then um franz it was an awesome point moving from that basic homeostatic framing where stress is usually considered at the first derivative or the state so it's like for a thermo-organism thermal stress is going to be when it's hot or cold and then that's going to be like a bowl or it's a v or it's a bathtub or it's some other thermal stress curve it's about temperature moving into the generalized coordinates of motion with temperature and change of temperature and change of change in temperatures all the higher derivatives of temperature that expands the space a lot because maybe it's possible that a temperature that you slowly reach like over 10 years is a different amount of stress than just jumping there instantly time matters and so the rates of change captures that time dependence in an instance with a snapshot vector so that's sort of the formal use of how we can look beyond just the stress on temperature and then we introduce the whole cognitive stress because he said well for the active inference entity this is sort of like the first resonance and this is the one whose violation of integrity results in physical death but then stress moves to higher or different analogous settings and that could be how fast am i learning and as pointed out by dave in the chat and by dean and others like it really matters whether somebody has agency or affordances to change it and so my closing point there with the voluntary involuntary is like grad school and stress because or any research or any educational environment but one that many people experience is like it can be stressful it's also a very often privileged setting to be in and one is taken care of sometimes in a way that even like neighbors won't be and so that is something that like i saw first and second hand and just thinking about the stress it's like why is it stressful to just read a few papers some days or something like that so just kind of interesting with what is voluntary and involuntary how we commit ourselves to different kinds of stress of what kind it's like well i wanted it to be novel but not that novel and how we actually make those action selections in uncertain environments blue so just to add on to the voluntary versus involuntary like grad school is an entirely voluntary endeavor obviously but like high school is not and like i dropped out of high school at 16. like as soon as i was old enough to drop out i was like i'm out like i'm not doing this compulsory regimented program like sorry um no regrets right like i started college obviously have a phd like did well but it's the difference versus involuntary versus voluntary like when it's in when it's compulsory it becomes torture like i mean just my just my two sets computational group recently about um you know the the this whole idea of like how do you quantify any kind of agency and uh josh bonga in that in that context works with us brought up this idea instead of talking about agency which is hard to quantify you can talk about empowerment and in the computational sense empowerment is about how much do your actions how much can your actions influence your sensations um again this makes um very very clear in an active infant scheme right where you have this markov blanket um so like to to support example right if you if you don't there's no actions you can take to change it that's you know we can think about it as natively stressful but we can also we can also define that fairly clearly in a computational sense using something like empowerment so it's it's uh and that again i like that you brought this up because this dries home the point that a lot of these fundamental things you understand about stress and human contact anyone that's ever dealt with depression or people that suffer from depression right knows that it's never really about the the the objective total amount of stress about about how it's being perceived by that person and i think this empowerment helps a lot this definition empowerment helps a lot to understand that better how much control do you have of that there's other things that of course feed into that but it also makes them fairly clearly that the same a lot of the fundamental principles must hold true and in lower organisms as well because these definitions are of course you know as soon as you prescribe actions of course you can argue that there's no real actions and and cell biology um then that's okay that's just then don't want to talk about that level but if you do look at active states in this other context then you do get then you can fairly simply in an active inference screen but other ones as well define empowerment measure empowerment over time by looking at how much how much how actions actually change the sensory states of the of the cell and then definitions of stress from that point of view all it's become fairly fairly explicit can i ask you a question yeah i can ask you a question because you mentioned in the when you were with us in the point one for a bit there and i don't know if you re-mentioned it today he said you went to mark i think and you said i want to do something cool we're going to bring this back to the voluntary and involuntary piece and then he and then you i think you said i think you said i'd never heard of active inference before i was pointed in that direction carl's lab so in the in the in the context of what's voluntary and involuntary when you when you when you said i want to do something cool that sounds like you wanted to do something voluntarily then you got then you got this deep dive into acting you push that up against your biology background which is something that you've obviously done because you like it right and you wanted to finish off so so going forward now that that voluntary piece that got you into the active inference what do you see the active inference doing in terms of this empowerment question because daniel's written it out here with a question mark behind it so how do you feel more agent a gentle agential sorry i always kill words because i'm not very anyway i'm just curious what you think now in terms of what sort of empowerments you've sort of um become in the in the sense that now that you've got this sense of what active inference can do and what some of these math formalisms provide and what this statistical uh world bridges yeah what do you what do you what do you like what are you thinking going forward in terms of the reapplication of what you what you pulled out of a out of a out of a different different bucket and and and then it's set down in the bucket that you're most familiar with so you mean like what where i put that on a personal level like for my life decisions yeah like when you're when you're going to be going forward and trying to and trying to use that active inference sense yeah in terms of some of those decisions and what kind of environments do you think you see yourself projecting yourself into that you may not have projected yourself into prior to sort of engaging or encountering or exposing yourself to activation yes that's a question um i think in the end it's uh my wife and i we both love this world where it's serendipity and we're just excited about happy accidents which there's all kinds of connotations there but an active infant scheme or any any you know when you look at you know what what is information for from you what the idea is that you if you have too much if you have so it's going really active inference right now i'm starting that if you have super high precision very strong prior beliefs then whatever you if you are confining yourself and you don't allow variances um to change your mind then then you're almost always going to be upset because you never you know your position is set too high right this is there's a paper going to be coming out soon about this collaborator as well looks the right precision in this context as well so that's something that you know any active inference model will know that you have to you know keep that in mind your precisions for me personally um it it really is an idea of like i think every interest this is not not novel idea by myself but i need to stretch but any any human tells stories about the environment but most about themselves and the storytelling is in my sense nothing else than doing a model an active influence scheme making a generative model and setting that so i think too for me to i'm way too young to be giving life advice but for me to to to achieve any kind of happiness you have to really be careful of uh what story you tell about yourself and how strictly you can find that on things and that is definitely advantage yourself i think personally i've always had better luck personally i think by by not not letting not define that too too strictly and really looking into what what your environment throws at you and i think that helps and i i know personally people that have a very hard time with that and that have very strong model stuff you know i'm gonna you know get married at that age and then do this and that and then when things don't happen that way i think it at least it's a lot of unhappiness so if you know in that context active influence what can i do for you i mean i think it's it it makes things explicit that we all kind of hear about some level and and you know i know when you confirm psychology but also just you know folk psychology things just people giving you advice parents saying i think oh now this is i don't want to say that you need i have images of any of those insights i think you can get this lots of ways but what i like about that inference scheme that it you know it's it's putting this dimension it makes makes the it makes the thing also biology the biggest advantages you get a very explicit uh structure about the information flow for very simple systems and because it's been primarily applied in neurosciences you get in for us intuitive results from that what happens if you have track precision what happens if you probably don't change what happens if you know if your energy is being minimized all these things i can fairly easily explain that in the context of of of human behavior because on lesbian's plight we all have to understanding um but i think there's um for the biology point of view there's there's a lot of things we can learn from that if you look at the fun the mathematical definitions then of course it deals with the baggage that you get from the neuroscience which you have to deal a lot with which is fair um but for your life i think it just helps you once you see really how how much study has been put into miss inference you know amount like bad inferences um and of course people doing tests and with scheme about you know psychological like behavioral task states um then i think that that's one lesson i can definitely learn from that if i hadn't already is that being be mindful of be mindful of your priors be mindful of the rate of change like how what are you really stressed out about right now what's the worst uncertainty coming from how much should that throw you off right and this is in a sense to kind of bring all this home a little bit um the the biggest limitation of of any algorithm of any model is that you are defining the general model beforehand not just an active inference scheme but any there's papers that come out that you know criticize the idea of artificial generalized intelligence because you always have predefined model and life on that sense but that definition is does not do that like always uh you know biological systems evolution kind of generates a bunch of diversity in its background and from that kind of um they pick the best path constantly evolve the generative model so you know that's kind of like limitation of active any other algorithm which can be overcome by you know chain different uh objects together by evolving system but having models make models there's some cool work on that too but that's something you need to take i think both computationally scientifically but personally take a mind off like at what point you change your own model and allow for flexibility that's what makes human right now still that's one of the soft acts that makes humans superior i would say into any um to any kind of algorithm right now it's because they all come predefined with life the heart molecule which again it's i don't really actually i'm saying this now and also don't actually agree with that 100 i don't actually believe in fundamental differences between different intelligences but that's something that at least uh kind of intuitively makes sense to us whether or not that's really true scientifically i have my my points that but that's going off off the rails awesome wow a few things like we often talk about concordances with different systems and it brings the cognitive apparatus that was developed for humans and starts to at least instrumentally if not from a realism perspective also project that and so it allows um as a trans discipline people to talk about systems and map their analogies and models in a way that would help us find the resonances between cellular metabolism and economics kind of taking a vague feeling like those might have some similarities into using the same notation terms forms etc so that's one very interesting piece about active inference and also the limitations in terms of at what order and how much time and attention is allocated to this structural aspect and how many different families of structures are provided on one and then to your um [Music] well-communicated uncertainty about if and how biology is different from other kinds of processes [Music] that's an awesome question especially connecting back to your point about the reservoir of energy versus how locally there can be a different energy or entropy balance so it's almost like there might be little pieces that can be mapped to digital signal processing with super high fidelity and that'll be taken as like a win for the realists and then there might be other parts where the instrumentalism bridges because we're just making a model of this one smaller thing and this one larger thing and then in cases where this is fully computationally defined or fully described then there's like a case for a real what does empowerment look like at maybe like a low organismal level or even like a cellular level how um like is cellular behavior or lower organism behavior like voluntary versus compulsory and like is there a way to measure that like obviously like you can trap an animal in a box and frequently like you know we'll frantically try to get out but if you don't try it would it go into the box and hang out there like like does that happen maybe i don't know does anybody know of any examples of like what um empowerment looks like at like that's just it's a super interesting concept to me um in the in the settings it's if you take that definition off um either conditional parts your actions change your sensory personal perceptions then and definitely yeah definitely you i would i will it's if once you have a definition it's of course built on what your diff actions are and that that is fairly easy and because you don't have to go into this route whether it's a volunteer or not you just base something internal state you're basically just even even limper you look at the the flow of states your markup blanket which you can show forms naturally which car is shown then from that point of view once you have active states then you can measure that fairly fairly easily so as an example i would argue if you know if cells actually interact with each other and really change other cell types we have here's a great example genesis is traditionally not yeah i think it's pretty fairly established it's really driven by life's organizings and it's always a subsequent of cells that will drive this cell the ones i would argue then that those cells are probably very much empowered because their actions uh cause differentiation of cells around them which then will very much and they're going to do a certain expression of well so then that will they actually very much control that whereas those themselves um yeah they're receiving and have a lower power because their their own signaling probably isn't really because they're not not they often just don't have that that they don't make a lot of that signaling celta that it's being organized in ireland so they are not going to have a low end let's think of that you're asking me what anyone yeah what as as our guest or anyone else is welcome to where there to go i i pressed some light to get to where the thumbs more than kind of uh qualitative like to make making actual like instead of just like making these abstract models of of active inference uh you know we can measure another hand if you can really map those two together right like in the sense that i mean a lot of work went into this whole spm software that they developed and uh in london and at this point right you actually can get fmri data and then you can do dynamic calls and model and you can really you can really postulate different causal models and then do a you know a bayesian belief updating you can do a hypothesis testing right in this in the sense that which hypothesis is more probable to have cost that you see um if we get to that level on a morphogens for example you can get the high fidelity images of the developing embryo that you would get with over time get signals that you can measure and feed back into your model and really make you detect the past of what cause a model like what structure would have caused these sensations that you or the the data that you're receiving that would be a huge step forward and uh microscopy is really doing some uh having some great advance on that one example i can give us a friend of mine works on that dimitri crum and he's been heidelberg and he would this light sheet microscopes there's a lot of other groups i mean he's a master student phd student um i bought all that from him but there's groups um you can do a high fidelity um light sheet from two sides we can really nice like near confocal resolution um but with high high temporal resolution um of their organism doing and recapture the entire process of of you know from castillation further on last that you could collect where you can read and start to make plastic causing molds in an active inference framework and then they basically request whereas the art poem there and you can really test and uh this this the idea that we already have as incentives i mentioned in morphogenesis and we test out how much that that fits into our notions of of com no uh delete updating and actions um that would i would love to see that in my lifetime wow super awesome so just to kind of restate that um spm has been developed in the capacity of behavioral neural imaging and so it allows a combination of observable features such as like what button somebody pressed or what image somebody was shown and also observable features of the environment like the measurements coming in off of the eeg or the fmri or the meg and it allows integrated modeling of those different kinds of parameters along with the dynamical causal modeling on the underlying dynamic system identification and there's a lot more in the spm documentation on that and so active here along with some advances in for example the ability to look at the process of embryogenesis and tract cellular location for a whole organism developing through time then that can be fit as if those are the fmri measurements of this embryo spm and then the underlying mechanics of development like a hypothesized morphogen gradient or a known or hypothesized mechanical relationship that's part of the model that's like the underlying neural systems model in spm and so it's kind of a great dream but if it can be stated if it's likely to exist it sounds like you're taking some actions that will reduce your surprise about it yeah pretty cool so on the microscopy note i'm like getting ready to um receive and set up a bio afm i'm really looking forward to like the multi-parameter capability of like i can look structures top a lot also like do fluorescence imaging so i'm really excited to have multiple affordances available on this same like the mic dances are great like i've used an afm and you know it gives you the mechanics of your sample but not not it's i've never also been able to look at the sample you just the mapping without being able to see it so i'm really excited to be able to see and measure mechanic what's going on in a cell but that's cytoskeleton um parameters i was discussing earlier about how that you know manipulates or enables cells to do different things cool let's look at any other things um or also we can sort of give a closing round whatever people feel like so one one thing i'd like to find the fight it's really about um the aberrant signaling figure so i don't think we went into figure five very much last time in the dot one and maybe uh you could talk about the aberrant's selling rescue kind of unpack that for us in your own words we're not seeing the slides anymore also daniel i don't know if you know that well i'm not yeah it's also kind of lagged on youtube so i'm recording it i'll re-upload like the high quality one it's kind of like weird it's a normal video chat but the youtube stream link is like disrupted but say lovey um yeah so actually if you don't see the i'm showing figure five even though you can't see it so just oh yeah or i see okay we can do that yes great thank you awesome yes for the voice so this is the the top row here's the normal simulation this reference right you start off with these eight cells in the beginning and then kind of have you know this vague uh they're very specified very low prior belief of what type they are as they kind of move out that density changes so the the hue tone here makes them means that they're now more the more better they are the more sure they are being this head type type cell um or in case of the green that the t and b where i base one one cell which you can see kind of heating off and the error points towards that had a reduced sensitivity to um two six basically had a really hard time basically um first of all you know it was much more it was longer kind of unspecified than its neighbor balls were and in the end it achieves actually it gets wrong cell typewriters not only is it a wrong position like there's no cell in the original one at that play and even were you expected to be either yellow or red or somewhere in between but not blue as it is down here so um in the sense the intention of of a cell of the cancer is i turn this that way because i think that's basically the first step in concentration is a misidentification of your environment and your your place in it all right the original paper from carlos called knowing knowing one's place the cell definitely does not know its place so this is what goes in and then here is where you have basically um the same as above but the overall not just the absolute flow of actually signaling it's like two one cells is to get to that has been up regulated so that each cell basin now drives more concentrations of cells to that cell and basically kind of tries the ideas to compensate for that the healthy and what happened which i didn't expect at all is that you have um if you're circulating with it more here so you don't see that so much yet you see the cell that kind of initially would have normally gone gone down small cell actually pushed out in the end yeah what happened the words is that those were put into most io off of of signaling concentration and loud arrangement allowed this cell to re-take a place that um is confirmed what you say in the type of mythology and what i also like to i always wait when i when i talk about this figure and um both figures really is you did not in the simulation at any point in time change topic morphology all the actual encoding was exactly the same so what they're expecting where they're expecting is exactly the same and that i think is where i see the fundamental to change the code right we we know that we have higher highest we haven't met now energy and fire we ever had and yet i think anyone really thinks that this is the way forward in all cases and an only you know if if you can do it and you really come to understanding that's great and you have no other options in an extreme case that is absolutely unwarranted i'm not trying to dissuade anyone anyone from advances in gene therapy but i think it's we you know there's the genome is so complex so many things that can go wrong we don't know all of the details that if you did not have to start messing up people loading that would be preferred and i think this is all and also from uh even just from a capability setting you know that you don't always have the capability not with high fidelity that you that we think often do so with our lab as well i kind of take at the core of my experimental approach to things is that i want to understand how how cells interact with their environment and organs and work on that manipulation basically control information and sensing and drive them towards different states again with that arlington and scale that we talked last time about you want to direct the floor do actually this time have i took my shirt i don't even see that right now i do have to want landscape there on my shirt this time um so that's kind of like what because you're trying to redirect the flow of telephate um decision making not try to manipulate the actual ambassadors themselves so what was the verb signal response oh sorry oh god blue there yeah the preserved signal response so what was what was that yeah what was how did you perturb the like did you cut it off did it get less information or did it like was it supposed to like infer an incorrect place like how exactly in that one cell did you manipulate the parameters of that one cell so that it went to a different place yeah basically um let me see i think uh it was basically done on the and uh it was a decrease in sensitivity is that what it was i'm trying to make the specific vision right now instead of hand waving the so let's see in the beginning that we also formerly injuries right so that that's basically the the how how much of a right this the how much actions are being updated based on sensory inputs um and we can we can put a gradient on there and decide on that of how much they act on that that is the part and that i manipulate here so but that basically means is that by altering the response capability of the cell how much how much sensory update up how many how much to what extent solutions are being updated based on external information flow and with what kind of uh you know power on top of that that by that you're basically upping or reducing the sensitivity to the environment you basically you misarrange you misregulating the again the compound essentially but that's that's downstream but you know you might be the potential of the cell to act as environments and do anything about and also even upstream how much sensing of that so in this case specifically it just wasn't really sensing as much of its environment as it was supposed to be since um it almost is equivalent to uh the argument or the dissolution of sort of nature and nurture partitioning by just taking a complexity stance kind of like evelyn fox keller in her book the mirage of a space between nature and nurture you were talking about a target morphology but then about how changes in the signal were about to do number 40 on the quantum fep paper and blue and our friend jason and i have been preparing a lot for it and i think separating quantum from the electrons and their behavior and just asking well what is quantum strategy or what does this quantum statistics or quantum information projected onto biology mean not how it's been approached from the mechanistic question which is quantum biology well that's about the synapses and their quantum mechanical properties or about photon tunneling or proton tunneling and like quantum effects but what about just using the statistics instrumentally of quantum and talking about situations with with complex patterns of uncertainty and observation bias and memory and modeling and all of that and this was like a dot two that kind of like opened up a whole new area for us in our discussions with morphology and like the spatial and the embedded and and then cracked a window into just another area we'll go into and you brought so many awesome insights so we really appreciate it yeah that talk should be a real pleasure i highly recommend tuning in chris fields is great too to listen to and it's uh some exciting work and um if you also if you have seen i'm sure you have seen that um the the particular paper from carl fristman he has a section there on quantum mechanics and it's uh it's a very cool section because he actually um derives i think the schrodinger occasion equation from from a essentially from actual inference point of view um from just a definition of what your log probability density is um very cool kind of uh you know and i don't know how much um that will fit into other and future work but the it's it's always very exciting to me when you see different fields at least formally being able to be related to each other um that usually means that something something going on i thought it's something fundamental we'll have more to say in dot 4 so and join us yeah and of course you're welcome any time to participate yeah carl and i think mike i think everybody is coming so if you want to come and sure join the panel you're more than pleasant all right to the events and pop in if it works so thanks again everybody um hope that the viewers can bear with a lag if it was there but um so peace out everyone thanks a lot for this great discussion thanks for having me bye bye you
