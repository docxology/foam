all right hello and welcome everyone it's march 17th 2022 we're here in actin flab live stream number 40.1 discussing a free energy principle for generic quantum systems welcome to the actin flap we're a participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference this is recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here all qrf and video etiquette for live stream will be hopefully following to learn more about active lab head over to activeinference.org and for the rest of active stream 40.1 um blue thanks for being the facilitator sure so in this stream today our goal is to learn and discuss this paper a free energy principle for generic quantum systems by chris fields carl christian james blazebrook and michael levin and we have both chris and carl on the stream with us today so if we maybe want to just start off briefly with doing some introductions so my name is blue knight i'm an independent researcher in new mexico and i will pass it off to the first author prince um hi good morning and uh thanks for attending this discussion uh this is a a paper about active inference um and how to place the active entrance framework in a quantum information theoretic setting so what i thought i should do to introduce it is just give a little bit of the motivation for doing that quantum information theory is an outgrowth of quantum theory that started in the 70s or or even you could take it back to the 60s if you wanted to and its goal was to consider physical interactions as information exchange processes and to reformulate quantum theory in this way and so it has a very natural kind of overlap with what carl has been doing with the free energy principle in terms of of reformulating physics essentially all of physics and information and decision theoretic terms so why why quantum theory why go to this theory that's often thought of as a theory only of very tiny objects that are moving very fast and the reason is that it's scale free and conceptually quantum theory is very simple and it has one core hypothesis which is the print the principle of unitarity and the principle of unitarity is simply the idea that total information is conserved so quantum theory is based on a conservation law a proposed conservation law conservation of information so what going to quantum theory really forces us to do is to take seriously the project that um carl spent a lot of time on in his uh particular physics paper in 2019 which is to understand what we mean when we say that we've observed a system multiple times what we mean when we say we've interacted with the same object multiple times and it forces us to uh or at least it encourages us to take that question seriously and it provides a number of tools for talking about that question and we'll talk about that as we get into the paper but um and that's in a sense our motivation it's to take this um very nice quite abstract uh but in a sense very fundamental toolkit that's based around the idea of conservation of information and apply it to this question of of active inference so i'll let carl pick it up from there nice well thank you it's a great pleasure to be here i have to say i was hoping to learn more a great opportunity from my point of view just to hear a conversation and probably participate in terms of how this sport run and control scale free background free and that's what i think is one of the the most attractive um parsimonious um benefits of taking a quantum perspective on this it reminds me of the queenian desert landscape a minimal assumption which which i'm always drawn to and apply this to some fundamental questions which have actually been beautifully listed for us at the top here about things and crucially um how things coupled to other things in terms of measurement and observation and inference so i'm personally delighted and hungry to learn about how simple questions about the nature of things um we observe and pleasure and make imprints about can be cast that was fundamental in this fundamental or from this fundamental perspective of quantum information very nice thank you james thanks for joining us would you like to introduce yourself and maybe say a few words about the paper or pick it up from there oh um hello um you may call me jim thank you um um you are you you you want a potted biography do you um anyway um i'm a retired academic um emeritus professor of eastern illinois university and adjunct associate professor the university of illinois at urbana-champaign um my background is global analytic geometry and some related areas but in the last uh 16 or 17 years i've been um applying mathematical techniques to cognitive neuroscience and foundations of quantum biology and more recently quantum information as as it relates to the free energy principle great thank you uh stephen do you want to maybe introduce yourself and give a thought about the paper something you like or remembered or curious about today yeah thank you hi i'm stephen i'm i'm based in toronto i'm just doing a practice-based phd into social topographies and community development and i have got backgrounds many years ago in chemistry and i'm i'm really curious about um the way that this idea of something that's scale free uh also ties to something which seems to be very specific on scale i wear something that's highly contextual and highly uh bounded by degrees of freedom at a certain scale and then how something could be inferred that's across all sorts of scales so that that's really something i'm curious about on this particular piece of great work daniel do you have any other like particular questions that you want to address or just looking forward to seeing the discussion and anyone who's watching live can ask a question so i'm curious about how also like steven said the specificity of a given experiment interfaces with general aspects of the formalism and uh many other things but we'll go go ahead blue well do we want to maybe start there do you guys want to speak to that scale deterministic aspect of the quantum fep well i can say something here um in any information theory will start with some state space so some set of degrees of freedom that have some set of values and in the paper we restrict ourselves to finite state spaces because we're really interested in systems that only have access to finite energy and so finite computational resources so one starts with a state space and in a sense that state space when viewed from kind of the external perspective of the theorist who's defining it sets the scale of the problem because in defining the state space you're saying what the values are of the degrees of freedom and when you say what are the possible values you are implicitly making some assumptions about resolution so uh and making some assumptions about measurement so for example if we think of a canonical quantum system which is a cubit just one a particle with a spin uh and we say the spin can be up or down um then we made an assumption about how how we can measure the spin and the most natural mathematical framework is a three-dimensional ball of values or sphere of values if you normalize them and that's making an assumption that we can measure the spin in any one of three directions um and so here we have imposed some possible values on this on this set of degrees of freedom and so in a sense we've set a scale for the problem similarly if we're talking about uh interactions between human beings uh clearly there are lots and lots of degrees of freedom that we can think of but we typically think about only a tiny handful of degrees of freedom that have to do for example with verbal communication or visual communication olfactory communication or some other kind of communication and we always impose resolution restrictions we can say this difference is detectable and these other differences aren't detectable and whenever we make a decision like that we're setting a scale and when we characterize the information theory is scale-free we're just saying that the formalism doesn't change when the scale changes so the formalism the mathematical description remains exactly the same regardless of what scales we pick by choosing the possible values of the degrees of freedom that we're talking about we don't change anything else about the way the theory works so that's that's all that's skill-free means it it doesn't mean that we've somehow abolished the notion of scale uh that's part of our experience um so it's not something we're going to make go away it's that we haven't changed the way the math works depending on the notion of scale and you know the most the most notorious example of that uh thing that we're not doing is the historical division of the world into kind of a quantum domain a classical domain in a cosmological domain where you use three entirely different theories right quantum theory classical physics and general relativity to talk about what's going on so that's not scale free there you're you're radically altering the mathematical description to deal with different kinds of problems so that's what we're not doing trying to use the same mathematical description uh to deal with all problems i think that's a really helpful description chris because so many times when we think about quantum we think about the very very very small like subatomic particles and so it's pretty amazing to see math that's interchangeable with my level of existence like not just tiny little pieces of me um being used from quantum theory what um is there any other math that you know of or any other um examples of math that's been interchangeable with like classical and cosmological and quantum scales ever before or is this maybe the first time that's ever been done oh well no if you look if you look back to classical physics in the era of newton or even i think the better representative is is classical physics is reformulated by laplace um in that era electromagnetism wasn't really understood yet so people were thinking about classical physics in terms of mechanical interactions and gravity um but the idea at that point was that forces act instantaneously and forces uh act with one over r squared dependence that was the only force that was really understood the force of gravity uh forces were symmetrical right newton's second law action and reaction and this theory was meant to be universal and so if you look at the structure of that theory as various people have pointed out i think nicholas guyson has written a couple of papers about this it's a non-local theory and even even in laplace's era they realized that there was a a deep issue with this theory that you know if a rock rolls downhill on the moon then that immediately affects the state of everything on earth it in fact immediately affects the state of everything in the universe so that starts to look a lot like entanglement that states are not locally independent um and that's that's the fundamental thing that einstein attacked about classical physics in formulating uh the theory of relativity was to insist on uh non-instantaneous forces which just means forces transmitted by some carrier which we call light uh but light is really just a carrier of information it could have been anything it could have been neutrinos or something like that um so what einstein did that was most revolutionary was to impose locality on physics and that in a sense divided the world into realms that from a formal perspective not just a practical perspective could be treated independently and so it's no surprise that einstein hated the idea of entanglement because entanglement was undoing precisely what he had done to in his mind repair physics so yeah i mean classical physics of the time of applause was formally a scale-free theory that's awesome thank you for uh the clarification there so einstein einstein broke physics uh stephen did you have a question yeah just one question sort of following from that is as someone sort of thinking about how this might play out in other ways is it useful to think about things all the way up from the smallest and systems all the way up down from the biggest and classical as being where we're trying to name things as systems so that because often i hear people talking system system systems only but the use of things seems to be important as well and i'm wondering if we should have more thinness in our way of looking at the world oh should i comment on that yeah okay well this i think you're raising here a really interesting question and uh when we talk about things as as carl so beautifully emphasized in his 2019 paper we are implicitly talking about something that has an identity and that maintains that identity through time and that's a deep philosophical assumption that's nearly always implicit i mean people just don't talk about that assumption very much and when we when we use the word system uh we're i think often trying to speak a lot more loosely but in fact our language doesn't let us speak more loosely if i talk about a system then implicitly i'm saying i've got a particular state space that's what a system is and if i talk about a different state space then i'm talking about a different system so uh let's apply that to something interesting like embryology uh i pick a set of degrees of freedom that are meant to be the degrees of freedom of the zygote and uh i then you know a few days later have a set of degrees of freedom that are the degrees of freedom of some kind of early stage embryo but i want to say this is the same thing as the zygote well i'm now really abusing my notation right in a really serious way by saying that these two are the same thing even though they have different state spaces so this is a i think this is a fundamental question for any science that bases itself on the notion of a state space how to talk about of moving between different degrees of freedom and associating those things with with some kind of evolution of a of a kind of meta thing that we regard as a single entity and this is this is one reason that uh at the beginning of this paper we assume that we have some single system that we divide into we draw a decompositional boundary and that decompositional boundary is basically arbitrary or it's completely arbitrary but when we're we're doing something like embryology we're looking at a decompositional boundary between the thing we're interested in the embryo and the rest of the universe including us that's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and so we need it we need a way to talk about that sort of thing and we just we allied that problem in this paper we we talk about a fixed decomposition uh that that divides the entire universe into two parts that we can characterize the interaction between but but yes underlying all of this is this much larger question of how we think about decompositional boundaries that are expanding with respect to some parameter that we call time of course that time is not anyone's observable time because we're we're trying to talk about it though at the level of the universe as a whole so we you can very quickly get into extremely deep questions so two things that um came up there uh really for me is like okay yeah you're thinking about the embryo suddenly that's like a system that's separate from the world but even like within the embryo like where do you draw the line between the placenta and the embryo and when so so like there's even some fuzzy blurring um at the developmental scale and also really the notion of time and time irreversibility and memory and encoding was just something i found absolutely fascinating about this paper so so you mentioned that um the the quantum the free energy principle for generic quantum systems does not imply like a space background like it doesn't need a space-time background to operate but then like brought time back in in terms of memory and encoding um and i just wonder if anybody maybe wants to speak a little bit more about that or or help us understand how and why you don't need space or time for its work well i could talk about that a little bit if no one else wants to pick it up let me go back to the first thing you said though blue which was about boundaries and how hard it is for example to draw boundaries in something like embryology there's another deep deep assumption that we make that the boundaries that we draw in the world are somehow ontological or objective and observer independent and quantum theory and and many other sort of theoretical approaches remind us constantly that that's a bad assumption that uh drawing thinking of these boundaries as antic causes all kinds of formal problems so for example the associativity of the state space multiplication operator becomes invalid so you can you have to throw out the whole vector space formalism oh so i mean real problems uh so so boundaries are observer dependent in any formalism like this so what do we mean by this universal time it's a construct it's it's a theoretical convenience and we map it on to our observable time which is time measured by our clock and since we're we're the theorists we can say okay we're going to privilege our clock and we're going to assume that our clock is somehow universal even though we know that that doesn't make any sense and when we think of space-time i mean the term background-free comes from cosmology or quantum cosmology and it's the idea that if we want to understand gravity or if we want to understand space-time as an emergent phenomenon then we need a theoretical approach that doesn't build space-time into it but if we think of biology how many organisms what fraction of organisms have anything like our experience of space to what extent is space part of the world of organisms that we're interested in and to what extent is space as we see it a construct of our ability to make certain kinds of measurements and then it's in a strict quantum theoretic formalism time is not an observable but distance is so it's an observable like any other so in a in a very strict sense quantum theory is not a mechanical theory because it's not really about things going on in an independent spacetime [Music] did you have a question yeah i'd just like to comment on and i say thanks for referencing state spaces for systems i think that's really helpful because i um i've been wrestling with this dynamical part of systems which is really helpful to think in dynamics but most or a lot of people when they talk about systems they just think about relationships between things and system dynamics i just flows as if it's like things being passed around rather than dynamical like processes so i think it's helpful to think about state space in that way to frame systems and i'm i'm just um yeah i'm curious about how we have to be careful about people who use systems in those other ways and don't have a dynamical uh concept of something which is non-linear being taken into account because that seems to be something that this approach really gives the ability to do so i wonder what your thoughts are on that carl would you like to say something to that yeah i'm not sure it's going to be deeply informed um so i'm i'm as i'm listening i'm so trying to translate all these beautiful ideas into a classical framework that i'm much more comfortable with so but the last point is um from the classical perspective absolutely fundamental i mean you start with a launch valve or a random dynamical system that is just cast in terms of flow operators or movement operators that you can cathex with time if you want to but just to reinforce um chris's point you know time and space um are both constructs and then you know they're just explanations for what well for these flow operators so if those flow operators have a dynamics then implicitly you've got a rate of change with respect to something which is time but uh you know that's quite a big move um and um [Music] so putting things in terms of mappings i think is absolutely fundamental so steve if your point was when you need to think about systemic processes or systems from the point of view of mappings usually associated some time i get the impression from um working with chris and jim that um there is an ordinal or a sequential aspect so just going back to the question where did memory get into the game you know that there has to be um there has to you know there can still be sequences or um your sets of things um that has constitute a memory but it doesn't have to have the attribute of um of time in the sense that we would understand a flow from the point of view of a differential equation so i'd like to hear that i'd like to hear sort of um uh chris and jim's comments on that while i'm talking though it um just this importance of um time as a construct um it does strike me that you know that takes um does a lot of heavy lifting if we just abandon the notion of some universal or clock time in relation to what i would um from a classical perspective um read the scale free aspect of and i'm thinking here of the renormalization group um i've been just to know that you know and i'm sure there is if there is a renormation group or the apparatus of the removalization group in quantum physics but from my perspective um that that notion of having a scale-free approach is exactly um what is the aspiration of any um in particular the free energy principle approach um would have when trying to account for the progressive um increase in the scale of a system but preserving exactly the same dynamics the same lagrangians the same so again from a classical perspective the same um the same functional forms for the the things that are concerned so yep this is to reiterate chris's fundamental point earlier on that and we're not talking about um a commitment to a particular scale be very very small or very very big what we're talking about it's a commitment to the same functional forms and the apparatus and the mathematics that underwrite the the the dynamics if you like and that's you're at any given scale and then that calls then into question how do you get from one scale to the other um and i'm one thing that sort of jumps out to you when you when you look at the the renormalization group in relation to um summarizing dynamics of random differential systems is that you get this time dilation or this you know you move from one tonight skill to another time scale um so i'm i'm coming back to the point that you know when you talk about time what's skateboard scale what time are you talking about are you talking about evolutionary time are you talking about um uh sort of you know the time that um the fetus is enjoying in its mother's womb or you're talking about the time scale appropriate for the the fluxes of ions over your cell membrane um so the deeper question here is that how does one temp one time relate to another um the people that i know who are interested in this issue from the point of view of the perception of time or time as a construct um usually fall back on information rates they usually fall back on the the rate of belief updating or the amount to which you have moved in some belief space technically manifold from a classical point of view but as soon as you say weight with respect to what um and then it comes back with some time which time and where you end up where you end up as well okay um i can't talk about any absolute information rate but i can certainly talk about um the number of moves i make at one scale per number of moves i make at another scale even we could be doing that in our heads you know when we very high scales say from the point of view of a generative model in our in our heads dealing [Music] with things that unfold very slowly in relation to fast move updating much closer say to our sensory organs or actuators um but it does make sense you know to actually talk about how much have i moved how far have i moved in terms of an information length in my belief updating in um at a higher level of a hierarchy or you know a higher scale in relation to the to the number of moons or how far i have moved we've got somebody okay okay or you can just um it'll be it'll be muted my that little response was very rambling because there are so many just like questions come up over the past 10 20 minutes i i like to pass that to to chris and jim now that i understood um to get their take on um how comfortable they would be by taking the notions of um say the renormalization group as applied to pathogenic formulations of random dynamical systems and whether that has any homolog or any currency in a truly background-free quantum population well i don't know well um basically i i think um what carl is proposing concerning the renormalization group and the van der waals theories um something to be investigated concerning um the aspect of um memory from the informational point of view and um may i speak about the specifics of our construction namely the cone cocoon diagram which um okay you could mute or just yeah that's all good we're going to be looking at the cone cocoon um maybe just chris or carl you can give a first pass like what is this being shown and also how does it relate to active inference oh hello okay welcome back uh local distraction um yes uh okay well uh you see at the beginning of the paper when we discuss discuss the holographic screen which underlies the markov blanket you have these preparation measurement operations which feed into the diagram diagram 14 um of which the lower part emanating from d prime is um a memory write system so as the um the top part is picking up information from the measurement and preparation operators there is a memory rights system being um implemented from the opposite direction um one thing i i would like to say about the individual classifiers that we haven't sort of um fully mentioned in the paper that an individual classifier uh can be the result of um an algebraic operation on on two other uh classifiers um these algebraic operations uh can be of the type such as concurrency or ortho currents for example when you have a system of trains going through a system of stations um the the classifiers in question uh can be um combined to that extent and also by choice so i i think the scope for what is happening informationally in diagram 14 is uh quite significant um originally um two spaces were applied to such areas as as as concurrency and um high dimensional automata um and also um we can look at the possible uh possiblistic uh case and there are ways of interpreting diagram 14 in terms of the graph network too so um i know this doesn't exactly answer uh carl's uh questions but um i i i want to say that there is the mechanism there um for the uh memory right so um this is um of course uh influential when uh you see that um inference leads to minimizing the variational free energy principle if you have any questions about those diagrams please ask me perhaps chris can elaborate on what i'm saying uh yeah let me make a background comment here uh which in a sense goes to uh one reason that we're using this quantum theoretic formalism if we if we think of everything in terms of a a quantum theoretic formalism in turn instead of a classical formalism then the only place that there's any classical information in the system is actually on the boundary between the two interacting components so um in that original i i don't know whether it's figure one or the the the very original idea in the paper is that we we have some closed system which we can think of as the universe as a whole or the universe of interest as a whole and it's in some quantum state and if we divide it into two and we make the assumption that the joint state after the division is separable that we've divided it in a place where the interaction of the system with itself is weak enough that we can think of the two halves independently of the two components independently then we have this natural sense of classical information written on that boundary and that's the sense of classical information that one encounters in the holographic principle in cosmology and it's it's in that sense of classical encoding that of this boundary serves as a markov blanket but since the boundary is the only locus anywhere of classical information in this formal description then any classical memory has to be resident on that boundary and this actually brings to mind a picture which was not included in this paper but that i'm using in a subsequent paper with mike levin which really is is just thinking of this boundary using a pie chart and as we pointed out in this paper uh another kind of classical information is the classical free energy flow that powers information processing so this this actually isn't the right picture but um and so one can immediately carve off a large chunk of the boundary and say okay this is just thermodynamic exchange these bits aren't useful to anybody they're they're the bits that are being used burned as power yeah this is a better picture for that and then there's a chunk of the pie chart that we can think of as perception and another chunk of the pie chart that we can think of as action but then some other piece of the pie chart has to be allocated to memory or there's no internal time right having an internal clock and having a memory are the same concept if i don't have any memory at all then i have no awareness of the passing of time and i have no internal clock so when jim talks about uh in that previous cocon diagram a memory right operation it's a memory right operation on the boundary and of course the the opposite partner in the interaction uh my memory segment of the boundary from my point of view might be my partner's perception segment of the boundary or might overlap with my partner's perception of the segment of the boundary i have no idea how my interaction partner cuts up the boundary from their point of view so um this is yeah that that's what this picture sort of illustrates uh so this question of of what is the memory also becomes observer independent which which gets back to this question of time and the relationship of time to a local clock and the relationship of a local clock to memory so whenever we talk about time as observed by someone oh we're making reference to a local clock and a memory resource and of course an energy flow that powers that memory resource and prevents it from decaying entropically so this i we keep circling back to this abstraction of the universal time that parameterizes the universal dynamics but um and you know this this formalism like any such formalism requires that concept is a theoretical construct but at least it doesn't confuse it with the the experienced time of any particular observer which has to be represented in this very different in this very distinct way awesome thanks so i think that is a perfect segue into a question that was asked by franz kutzling in the live chat um and also mike levin has joined us i don't know if he's able to talk he says he's having some internet issues mike did you want to say hello before i asked franz's question if you can be muted um okay i'll ask the question and then we'll see if mike figures out how to unmute and say hi um so franz asks how does the definition of a thing that maintains its identity over time scale with time scales or over scale with time scales there you go how does the definition of a thing that maintains its identity over time scale with time scales what i still didn't get it for example i would call something a thing if it persisted for some time with respect to my observational time scale so in other words can quantum theory say something about how to set temporal observer limited boundaries of defining a thing there's a lot in there yeah um we see many ways um some that are actually implicitly scale friendly or scale free like the hierarchical parametric models in spm statistical parametric modeling that's separating like in a multi-scale experimental design from an experimentalist's perspective into signal and noise including the combinatoric interactions in a classical parametric state space and there's also um the uh bayesian identification of parameters which also is just as was brought up scale implies choosing what the state space is and so what statistical variance gets partitioned into the noise term or the kind of ripple term and what gets partitioned into the wave term into the signal into the regression slope rather than the variance term these kinds of variance partitioning questions can be approached in a instantaneous sense like descriptive statistics even if it's about time series and um i think a theme that we're hearing brought up is that taking repeated measurements seriously brings in a whole host of essentially cognitive features like as well as information theoretic perspective dependence all of these features that are um tucked under the rug or um down projected onto in a special case if we just assume a synchronous universe um or a synchronous regression it's a totally different scenario but considering this quantum statistical background helps us deal with the cognitive modeling and also take the consequences of action into account because action is implied in the measurement preparation recording experimental active inference cycle it was just so subtle in the paper we said all inference in this scheme is active inference but the paper was about quantum and the fep um thanks uh could i bounce off what daniel just said very quickly because uh i was also thinking about the nature of action i thought i was um so i thought what daniel just mentioned there ties in with is is if memory happens via there being some action and then the action defines the memory scale there's um so i think that makes that that that starts to define a scale so i'm curious that if if there's something different between the the temporality of a thing maintaining its thinness and the sort of temporality of um actions by systems of things because i think things can only act to maintain their thinness but they don't if they start doing things with others they become a system so i suppose you've got where where that action still starts to come into the equation or am i mistaken there can i address that briefly yeah i i think a relevant the relevant fable here is the fable of the two drunks who are walking home from the bar leaning on each other and if they're lucky they manage to keep each other upright if if if we if we think of an observer in an environment and so we draw a boundary between the observer and the environment and we think about the observer's interaction with its total environment then we've divided the boundary up as we were talking about earlier uh into a pie chart where you know a large fraction of the bits are fuel and so they're uninformative and there's a perception space in an action space and a memory space and so on now let's think about what happens when the observer identifies a thing embedded in the environment so the observer has now segmented or sectored the the perception part of the space into a part that includes bits that represent the state of this thing and the rest of the perception space which are bits that represent the background that the thing is embedded in so the things environment and so the question becomes what does it mean to say that that thing remain retains its thinness its identity over time for that observer uh well that means that that observer is able to maintain this distinction between bits that communicate information about the thing and bits that communicate information about the thing's environment so this becomes a cognitive question about the observer so it's the question how does a thing maintain its identity is replaced in in this way by the question how does an observer of a thing maintain the thing's identity for himself or for itself how does the observer uh maintain the ability to lock in on this thing is distinct from the environment and um [Music] so let's let's go to an example right think about motor babbling in an infant so here's this infant she's lying on her back she's waving her arms and her legs around and what she's doing in this motor babbling is figuring out the relationship between the motor system and the visual system so among other things she's figuring out that some that something that she sees some visual stimulus is actually part of her body it's a hand and that at a certain moment she begins to be able to control what this hand is doing uh using visual and motor feedback so here's here's a living example of an observer of fixing the identity of an object and what we're trying to do here in a sense is use this as a is is to insist on thinking about thinghood always in this observer specific way so i noticed that carl just raised his hand so let me turn it over completely to him to carry on with that or contest it or give a different perspective no i do i don't want to contest it i want to fully endorse that and if you just look at the free energy principle as classically formulated it is exactly uh along the lines of the uh the thickness being an attribute of the observer so if you just start off with the notion of a markov blanket that stupidly defines a thickness how is the markov blanket defined well it's defined by the conditional independence between the dynamics on the inside versus the outside but of course those dynamics are not observable once they're on the inside from the outside by definition so you're immediately imputing some magical observer that could actually recognize that independence before you've even defined what a thing is so i just wanted to to you know um in an abstract and possibly even philosophical way and reinforce this notion that thingness does you know is an attribute of something that could possibly observe it even from the classical perspective of the free energy principle predicated on the notion of a mark or blanket that is in turn uh defined in terms of conditional independences or disentanglement um but the the that example of the um of motor babbling i think is that you know again a lovely illustration of um observation underwriting thingness and in this instance um your highly anthropomorphized thing that's name is selfhood you know to to develop the hypothesis or the explanation for my holographic screen or my um all the uh information on my markov blanket that a a plausible parsimonious explanation is that i am a thing i am a self i am me is is actually you know takes months if not years to fully actually uh you know arrive at as you're an infant slowly discovering that i am different from mom and perhaps mom is different from the background and ultimately perhaps i am something like mum uh so you know these um the emergence of thingness i think is it is quintessentially observer dependent both mathematically and in terms of developmental uh psychology great thank you oh crap did you want to head on sorry i was trying how lucky the technology so maybe i will put put this back to carl maybe you were talking earlier before jim started talking about the rate of information flow and the rate of belief updating and so i just wonder i've been curious about this actually um just in terms of human information like are we really bombarded with more information now than we used to be um and is this like influencing our rate of cultural change cultural evolution because as a culture like we update our beliefs more often do you think that these two things are proportional the rate of information flow and the rate of belief updating something i've been thinking about yes no i i'm sure that's absolutely right and right i think you know at every scale of analysis um so you could look at it from the point of view of culture and the availability of information on social media and globalization uh at a cultural scale but you could also i think um bring us back to motor bubbling that you know the degree of bleep updating an infant has to do um is clearly going to be much greater than somebody um of of my age um so you know time will a year in the life of an infant will not be the same as a year in the life in my life and you know i think that that is a direct reflection of the degree of belief updating interestingly that that question um touches upon the separation of time scales which i think underwrites everything that we're talking about here um so you just stand back again and go back to some of uh chris's earlier observations um about the remit of the um the paper in question um it was really at any given but not specified scale um where we could assume that um [Music] we didn't have to worry about the separation of time scales from the point of view of a cognitive neuroscientist for example what we're talking about is inference where inference in this instance would be read as um a kind of reading and writing onto this holographic screen or if you're one of the perspective um the you know the updating of um active and sensory states on the on the markov blanket um but under the assumption that the the the other things that change at a slower time scale are not changing and those other things might not be might be for example at a slow time scale they might be learning so you've got this notion that the the formalism at hand the reading and writing at hand from the information theoretical perspective could be a very good metaphor for inference you know over a short time period where there um where things are not changing very quickly from a point of view on the things to be learned so within a few seconds or minutes of the life of the zygote acknowledging that you could apply the same apparatus and the same mechanics at a slower time scale that would account for the transition from a zygote to a to a neonate as it learns so the difference between inference and learning i think is is a nice common sensible example of this separation of time skills so when you ask about you know cultural information available i think you're probably talking about a scale of learning um and absolutely you're when we learn we update our beliefs there it will be from a classical perspective a statistical manifold that holds those beliefs and you're literally moving over that um and with respect to another scale and then the degree of belief update and the degree of asking questions the degree of read writing um will certainly be be a function of the amount of reading or writing that's going on and i can imagine that somebody somebody who has access to wikipedia or news on social media is doing a lot more read writing than i was saying in the 1960s [Music] okay you're moving but to me blue yes to you so carl you made a fascinating point about connecting the motor babbling and taking it into the informational and the belief updating domain um into the adult where we're kind of motor babbling on social media in a way that has different dynamics than before um and people often give the example of like well a year feels longer for a seven-year-old because it's the seventh of their life but then for the 80 year old it's an 80th of their life so that piece of the pie is smaller versus bigger and that is implicitly the fallacy of the observer independent time as if there was a linear chart that was being linearly divided by some static observer whereas another way to look at that or an alternative model is like the rate of development or experiences or change or novelty or continue to explore and don't worry all mute james is that oh he's muted on the live stream so it's all those um that uh rate of belief updating could set that internal kairos that biological time like that biological information geometry and so it connects the cognitive sciences and also the statistical perspectives that have been discussed to this time question which as also brought up earlier does so much work in so-called dynamical modeling and it just makes me think about how there was a movement from the observer independent synchronous into the relativistic which prepared and almost like prepared the partition to exist so that all these other domains like the holographic principle could come into play so my question for any of the authors is where does the qrf come into play and how does this relate to discussions of pluralism and polycentrality awesome question jim did you answer well um i i wonder if you can bring up a diagram there um in the paper uh let's see sure yes it's diagram 34 well there you have a configuration that um relates the qrf to the cochlear cone diagrams and we say here that um let's see um well here we focus on co deployable observers uh when this uh diagram uh commutes um it is interesting of course um when the diagram doesn't commute and then you have a kind of intrinsic uh context uh reality so um i i i think what this is saying is that um there are there are certain elements of um information represented by the logic of the distributed system in question that are um kind of uh ambiguous or um rather they're manifest in um classifiers and infomorphisms that um aren't defined or um the co limit the bolt c at the top there uh does not exist so um this is a very useful criteria uh i think to uh distinguish between sort of um empirical models which the best part are based on co-deployable variables and what happens when quantum contextuality um occurs the that is diagram 34 um doesn't uh commute so there's some sort of uh discrepancy there in the um uh mechanism of the quantum reference frame um relative to the dynamics of from the markov blanket or the the holographic screen underlying it so um there is some kind of distortion in meaning um that results in this sort of intrinsic contextuality uh i i i don't know if that's a satisfactory uh answer at all but um when this breaks down i haven't seen that before it sounds good i'm sorry there's another local distress it's all good chris did you want to add on to that or maybe make another comment uh well i wanted to go back a little bit to the basics of what a quantum reference frame is because this is a concept that is both very familiar and i think a little bit unfamiliar and the the term was only coined back in the 1990s when uh the the idea of of a quantum measurement was associated with with the idea of uh the the units in which the measurement is made and what are the requirements for a measurement being meaningful and we're going to get right back to the same issues we've been talking about with respect to time and thingness but a a reference frame is just a way of giving meaning to an outcome and it's it's what allows outcomes to be compared so if i have an apparatus like a meter stick i can go around and measure lengths and as long as i believe that my meter stick maintains its identity as long as i believe that my meter stick remains the same thing then i can compare the lengths that i've measured but if i don't believe my meter stick remains the same thing [Music] uh then i then these length comparisons are meaningless so the notion of of a reference frame is is intimately tied up with this notion of meaning which in a in this free energy principle context is really a notion of actionability uh can i use what something means to guide my actions and my decision-making so this notion of a qrf becomes a notion of giving of giving an outcome value that i obtain and write in memory comparability with other outcome values that i maintained and write in memory and we're very used to you know as human beings we have this incredibly complicated sensory and inferential apparatus that involves many many degrees of freedom and many many values that are distinguishable so i think if we want to think about something like the role of of reference frames in perception it's it's better to think in terms of something like e coli oh and so think of a much simpler kind of system that can measure fewer things right e coli can measure concentrations of salt and sugars of various kinds and those concentrations are meaningful to it those concentrations allow it to make decisions because its internal biochemistry assigns them an actionable meaning so chemotaxis in e coli works uh because the level of phosphorylation of a particular chemical remains reasonably constant that's the reference frame [Music] and concentration levels can be compared to each other as long as that phosphorylation state remains reasonably constant that reference frame is meaningful and so chemotaxis makes sense because e coli has if you will a slow clock how the phosphorylation state of chi y uh that assigns that that confers meanings upon its outcomes so now we can spool back to what jim was saying about co-deployable reference frames of reference frames that i can use at the same time [Music] that i can obtain information from simultaneously have to commute this is what heisenberg's uncertainty principle is about oh and if i can't use them at the same time it's because they don't commute if i use them in different orders i get different answers and what that means is that by switching reference frames i'm effectively changing the the calibration i'm effectively changing the meaning that i've assigned and uh i think a very beautiful place to see this uh is the paper a paper that we reference here uh from cervantes in zafra and zafrov called the snow queen experiment uh the paper's called uh snow queen is evil and beautiful i'll came out a few years ago and basically this paper is demonstrating quantum contextuality and human decision making and it's doing it by exploiting differences context dependent differences in the meanings of words so it's it's it's perfectly pointing out this relationship between meaning and co-deployability and hints and hence context dependence in human cognition so that's that's a paper i'd very much recommend reading thank you so much carl did you want to comment on that also yes i'm aware that stephen also the question but uh just to follow up on on um that um beautiful deconstruction um [Music] this is more of a question but i'm going to state it as an observation um this notion of the qrf as being fundamentally getting um measurements right or metrics right would be understood from the point of view of inference technically um as getting um an internally consistent metric correct and the metric we're talking about is a fisher information metric so um you if you look at all reading and writing or action and sensation from a classical perspective as just trying to minimize some divergence or some prediction error what you are saying is that you are trying to find an internally consistent metric in an information space um that makes sense of your active sampling querying the world um so it just sounded to me as if what chris was saying was exactly uh getting the measure the measuring stick at least behaving consistently you'll never know whether it's changing its length or not but at least if it behaves consistently in relation to what you can see of the world the way that you can query that world actively then that's good enough and that of course is is um one way of simply stating that the name of the game in active imprints is just to minimize your prediction error where you are now reading prediction error as a kl divergence and of course the the information length or the amount the measurement of movement the metric is just a uh a path integral of infinitesimal changes in kl divergence so it's been from a mathematical perspective on the perspective of information geometries there's a beautiful link here between aligning your qrfs and getting your generative models right to make the most sense in the sense of minimizing or making as internally consistent as possible all your information metrics awesome thank you um before we go to stephen's question we have a question or two from the from uh ander aguirre in the live chat he asks does the existence of a holographic screen slash markup blanket automatically yield a statistical manifold for the belief state of the agent and is there a canonical renormalization procedure for a quantum mechanical system if there is one how would the core screening translate into the statistical manifold oh i i can take one quack at that which is uh if i if i'm coarse graining something [Music] if if we think of this in terms of qrfs uh then i'm i'm deploying a different reference frame with lower resolution so the in a sense what's being renormalized is my representation of the units that i use to distinguish states of the world so if if i have a meter stick uh that's made of stainless steel that has millimeters indicated on it then i can go around and make measurements in millimeters uh that if i coarse grain to a meter stick that only has half centimeters indicated on it uh then i've lost a factor of five in resolution i've coarse grained by a factor of five and so i've i've in effect rounded off all my outcome values and now my my function of comparing outcome values is is differently defined because it has to work at this lower resolution and if i want to compare my previous values to my later values i have to incorporate this explicit roundoff function into my comparison of values because i've changed my qrf so so coarse graining which which of course couples to scale changing uh from the very beginning of our conversation can be thought of as a transition from a a very a qrf with some grain size to a qrf for a similar degree of freedom with a different grain size uh and that has ripple effects uh through everything including the the free energy cost of memory right if i'm if i'm writing two-bit numbers into memory then that's a lot less expensive than writing five-bit numbers into memory so um this raises the another aspect of this question of renormalization which is how does it influence how can i use it to solve the trade-off problems that arise if i'm an organism with a limited fuel supply which of course i am [Music] of going about the world trying to gather uh preferentially the gather the information that's going to be most useful to me at the lowest possible cost so again we get back to this key issue uh in in all of active inference of balancing of the risk of exploration against the reward of new information uh and coarse graining is is intimate to that and it involves the choice i make of the tools that i'm going to use to make measurements and how that choice impacts my need to allocate computational resources and energy resources to what i'm doing too to the to the complex task of of getting new information while at the same time surviving awesome thanks daniel did you oh carl do you want to speak to that first perhaps stephen should ask but then i can come back to what just said yeah i'll um make a note and then carl would be great to have your response and then stephen's your question so to transpose it into statistical parametric mapping the true classics there's a mapping from the measured voxels which are being defined by the resolution of the eeg or the fmri machine that's the holograph that's like what the experimental apparatus is providing is the measurements those are the o in our partially observable markov decision process it's the predicted value in the regression and that space you know if it's 128 channels in the eeg and they're getting this sampling rate that is the state space that's being discussed and that's being transposed or mapped or connected to a different statistical space with different features and rather than the voxels there's like the mapping onto res else so carl that's why i'd appreciate if this is um true or not but those are the resolution elements and that it can be like a coarse graining and in that um stretch meter stick and different space there's a lot more statistical inference options available that are just not accessible at all from the um voxel coarse graining which is noisier and there's a signal enrichment in the coarse graining to the results that's appropriate and then that gets juxtaposed with the contrasts which is the experimental design of the scientists like you couldn't differentiate um a versus b category if you only tested a so the experimental design that's where like the statistics actually comes into play and then um just as chris said there's the organism with limited food supply and then there's like the scientists with limited time attention computer storage processor time funding maybe seven billion people like he just there's plausibility and so that's where this operational co-deployment connects with experimental design and so many of the patterns and analogies exist in the purely classical domain of the parametric statistics like spm in the classical physics and the flow and the information flow area that's coming into play and also these more recent in quantum areas so carl would love to hear your thoughts on that yes of course i'm i'm mindful that stephen's still great but um perhaps i'll i'll speak to that and then um uh stephen can i ask a question but i think yes that i think you know these questions and daniel your responses are touching uh chris's attaching on something really fundamental so just to um answer the question from the point of view of markov blankety yes it does automatically yield a statistical manifold or at least it looks as if there is a statistical manifold um if you can observe the uh the behavior of the thing that you are observing um [Music] the second thing uh question um which we've been focusing on and the core screening i i i think that's a really fundamental thing i would um argue that not not to conflate too much the notion of renormalization which would be i think um more a question of how you get from one scale to another scale um with the notion of course grading which is which could be read just simply as a degree of quantization or choosing the right resolution element the right um course grading of a given qrf at any given scale you could argue that you could contextualize it but i think there's a there's a more fundamental um argument here um and that's um the argument that there will be from a statistical perspective an optimal core screening for any given um holographic screen or exchange over a markov blanket and that's the one that statistically maximizes the marginal likelihood um which you could if you like relate to this sort of getting the measurements as internally consistent as possible maximizing the predictability of the next measurement you make that goes hand in hand with a maximization of the marginal likelihood or a minimization of the variational free energy that is important to remember because the marginal likelihood can always be expressed as accuracy minus complexity where complexity scores the degrees of freedom you're burning up if you remember about the uh the the the the bits on the on the holographic screen you need energy um um to um to from a classical perspective represent and what that translates to in a very simple way in terms of probability distributions and functionals is in maximizing the marginal likelihood or the evidence for your aligned or model of the world you are to maintain a certain degree of accuracy trying to minimize complexity so you're using as few degrees of freedom your core screening to the extent you can get away with while maintaining an accurate account of the um of say the sensory states um or the perceptual space on your holographic screen and if you know um from the point of view of active inference just think about well what would that sort of accuracy and complexity look like in terms of the consequences of action you get exactly what chris was talking about which was the um the expected uh complexity um being the risk usually and i mean risk in the sense of an economist or basin decision theorist it is literally mathematically the same thing the expected accuracy now becomes um you're a sort of um expected utility or the um the um expected uh log evidence the other the likelihood uh the expected likelihood that you would um get if you could if you committed to this kind of course screening so this course grading is absolutely fundamental it's really interesting to go back to um the all the sources where where the core screening uh starts to make a difference and i'm thinking here coming back to daniel's uh notion of resolution elements you know you find this in sort of vena filtering you find in the match filtering theorem there is an optimal level of smoothing or blurring for any given kind of data about which you want to make an inference or you want to assimilate um you see this um in formulations of universal computation that themselves are based upon solemn of induction that get you right back to kamalgarh complexity and compressibility so you see it in the drive that underwrites all formulations of universal computation to maximize compression by minimizing the complexity of your of your message passing getting as efficient and as simple as you can and of course this best way to make your account as simple as possible is to course grain it and i think you also see it in the sort of the different levels of um cognition in psychology and in neurophysiology in the sense that the higher level more efficient ways in which we align our qrfs or optimize our generative models always lead you to a very coarse grade quantization of the world so for example i um represent i am sure in my brain and some neural populations the fact that i am in my study i do not represent that in terms of very fine grained xyz coordinates down to the millimeter i represented no i'm in my study i carve the world at its joints and those joints basically demarcate the the kind of corresponding i bring to the bring to the table there are all sorts of arguments you can pursue here to to vindicate this is the very existence of receptive fields tiling a censorium in a way that is covered by discrete quantized receptive fields tells you immediately that the way that the brain represents stuff on the inside the if you could look at it through brain imaging is in this quantized fashion this course grained fashion and those that cause grainness and the size the deployment and the organization of those receptive fields has been optimized at many different temporal scales so i just give you a few takes on course grading or something absolutely fundamental to the structure of a generative model or to the way that we um we align our qrs to to make sense of of of the stuff on the holographic screen or at least when when we are when we are reading from that and sense making in that sense great thank you stephen did you want to ask the question yeah thanks no this is really cool um it was going to come back a little bit to now in the past and um the the idea that you mentioned about the way that we interface or the assumptions of the interface then changes how we um we resolve the thing and the background situation situatedness of that thing so and so it's like and so that could then also and this is the question in a way is how can that also because if the way that that thing and the assumptions are made sets up like the meaning for influence the action policy selection and the way things are thought about how can that itself change the way the brain or the way that organisms look at the what things are for instance in the modern world we do see everything as things we carve things up we see things as separate like an individual is separate whereas if you go back to sort of indigenous approaches time for them was cyclical or followed the river going down a hill or so there was a there was a complexity focus in a way it was almost like the mounting car problem of finding the landscape of meaning rather than defining the thing and what it is and carving it so i'm curious about is this how much is the way that the the quantum reference field you know translated into thinking about what that thing is and how that you know compares to say our western cognitive frames which kind of we measure everything because we can because basically we can control our environment so heavily we've we can make things very accurate whereas in the past it might have been you know the kalahari bushmen or the people in the middle of the amazon that somehow go with the landscape of complexity so that the way that that is understood is going to be different so i'm just curious about how you think about that ways of knowing great question i wonder also if that ties into um the individuality of of temporal scales like you mentioned the the cyclical time and um back to franz's question maybe earlier about um how and a thing over time that stays a thing over time scales with the scale of the time or with the cyclical nature of the time or it reminds me back of um when we had chris and shawna here talking about like flattening time maybe that was just shanna's talk but um yeah anyway i don't know do you guys anybody have any temporal comments just that there's an analogy to the synchronization of clocks which is a huge part of computer science and of quantum and other areas that question of synchronizing clocks seems to have some relationship to cognitive model not naive um [Music] congruence in terms of synchronization but in terms of like time zone coordination so if we're in the same time zone then there's a comparability but for cognitive states and so i think that will be something awesome to explore in next week's session and of course in the long run about what that kind of semantic and rhetorical and narrative alignment that isn't congruence but reflects a broader frame which actually the differences within the frame are the search through that field thanks uh and in the interest of of temporal comments i think um maybe does everyone just want to go around and um you know give a final thought and maybe an idea of what they would like to see in next week's discussion and we will start with stephen yeah thanks lots of lots of interesting things i suppose i'm yeah curious about this the way that um collapsing of the quantum reference frame might scale differently or might the assumptions that lead to the collapse could inform different scales of uh interactions and mixing and blending of the behavior and uh yeah digesting a lot of stuff that's come up so yeah thank you for for the opportunity to talk to you awesome uh daniel anything you want to see happened next week we always think of the dot zero it's kind of like dropping into the skate park or the bathtub um and so that was like a microcosm of all the threads that get brought together and then in dot one i feel like we opened up so many areas of possible connection and so i'll just look forward to the second repeated measurement of this semantic or regime of attention space and see how the continued interaction and engagement updates our generative model pass the dot to even awesome carl or chris do you want to give a thought about what you'd like to unpack in the next discussion should i go first well chris thinks of something very common to say um so it's probably all from from daniel to a certain extent uh stephen's question as well i'd like to hear about the principle of unitarity um entanglement and um its relationship to this notion of synchronization and the mutual alignment of qrfs between things that are coupled so coming to the regimes of attention i i think that could be a very transparent link there in the sense that contextualizing your qrf i think for a cognitive neuroscientist would be getting your intentional set right and possibly an implicit course grading that comes along with a particular attentional set um taking that that notion to attending to others and synchronizing and communicating and living in a universe that is also composed of things like me um i think bring brings some fundamental questions about classically generalized synchronization quantum theoretically entanglement and enabling that entanglement in the right kind of way um via aligning your qrs and getting the course grading right in sympathy with your partner so that i'd like to hear about the principal unitarity entanglement and how it relates to classical notions of communication mutual inference and generalized synchrony well thanks for stealing what i was gonna say um i i was also gonna say um how the there's one like the final concluding part of the paper talks about how the fep is asymptotically the principle of unitarity and i i really would like to dive into that more and maybe any potential implications of that and now chris gets the final and cleverest word uh okay this this won't be terribly clever uh what i was going to do was to uh recommend uh a lovely paper by alexi grinbaum that we refer to in this paper and the the closing sentence of that paper is that physics is really about languages and i think this ties in nicely to some of the issues that stephen was raising in his last question which i found very interesting about you know how how do conceptual schemes evolve at the cultural level and i i i in hearing about uh the the whole issue of reference frame synchronization uh or or reference frame alignment and how that relates to entanglement this this really is a question about language and um that that paper by alexei grinbaum i think makes this point very very beautifully uh so that that would be a nice thing to look at at some point um let's see this is that's probably a newer paper by him uh the one i was referring to is uh titled something like uh how device-free how device-independent methods change the nature of physical theory or something like that it was published in uh studies in history and philosophy of science 2017 or something like that okay anyway thank you very much for this yeah this was um very interesting and engaging and really appreciated everyone's participation and blues facilitation so we'll look forward to seeing anyone just drop in or out when it works for you next week at the same time in number 40.2 so until the next measurement thank you
