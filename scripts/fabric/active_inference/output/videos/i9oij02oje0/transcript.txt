hello and welcome it is July 12th 2024 we are in actin math art stream number four today joined by Kirby nner Kirby please begin okay thank you for having me everyone there's been a little bit of email traffic leading up to this and I've been attending to this Channel and I wanted to just point viewers who see this later to that this is episode four and they're already on a journey and it has to do with visualizing the fourth dimension and applying art towards this Challenge and it's kind of a puzzle piece that Daniel knows that I know for sure I don't know if everyone knows but there is kind of I feel in the hiker metaphor that you've climbed pretty high now and here's an overview a view of like a neighboring or adjacent space where 4D is also important fourth dimension Etc now I know there's some Vicken Stein knowledge around here so operation Duck Rabbit is an illusion to the kind of gestal shift you need and I just drew this it's very poorly drawn I have a doofy style of drawing I'm influenced by Mad Magazine I think and the the rabbit looks kind of sad you can see it's kind of Wiggly mouth that's just trying to do feathers on the back of the duck's head I was trying to like compromise there so it's both a duck and a rabbit and this is one of the easy ones right there's a lot of these that flip at you like this one it's easy to go back and forth between the duck and the rabbit but some of them you just can't do it people try to help you they coach you well look at it like this and it doesn't help right you can't see the old lady or whatever they're trying to so that is a challenge and it's part of what it means to kind of ease into some new field you have to develop the gals Associated there with so the outline of what I plan to do real quick Duck Rabbit kind of drawing from my Vicken Stein background I had Ry who's into pragmatism as one of my thesis advisers I did have to write a thesis even though I was just an undergrad at the time and Def it and blah blah but I wrote on the later Vicken Stein right there's two Vicken Stein for those who aren't familiar he's got sort of an early philosophy and a later philosophy so on that note of how things evolve how we don't end up where we start necessarily this picture shows what I'd call ukian geometry going forward in time and it kind of forks when they realize oh the fifth postulate we could mess with that so we can have nonukan geometry in that sense and relativity kind of comes in around there I'm talking about Einstein ukian continues and I'm forking off another name space as I call it synergetics kind of more off the Einstein stuff than off what I call Extended ukian ISM which is ND Hilbert space fourth dimension as another spatial Dimension not time there's a difference so there's three name spaces here I'm drawing a triangle I'm saying these exist and come and go so name spaces is like a shop talk a context or as mikenstein would say a form of life a grammar like Tess versus Checkers they come with a whole different world not just the games but the tournaments how it is and then look more at some of the Bucky stuff what what is it now let's start with the language game since yall are math fluent don't feel bad about just starting with some notation in this culture let's say these are like Mongols and the Himalayas or something let's say we unearth this archaeology this existed at one point and instead of negative numbers and positive numbers they decided to add another tupple so the negatives they've got a one to the right now this may look bad it's like well no if it's on the right then the tupple should be the rightmost tupple and blah blah so you could flip it whatever don't overthink it and then the same culture when they want to get to a plane or a flat space B they do it like this with three um fences you could call them reference lines what we' call vectors or Rays or whatever and you can see how if you have a dot in this part of it between A and B just using vector addition right you only need so much a and so much B to get there so a combination a linear combination of A and B bases vectors is sufficient to get any point in this part of the Y this is just a flat y there's no perspective implied here there's no 90Â° angles it's just a y flat on the plane but I'm showing how you have a zero for everybody here in the third place because there is no C component of resonance of this Tri I'm trying to think of a region that's triangular this triangular region then we go to the quad version of it um where we divide space into four quadrants again we add another coordinate for the new uh vector and by the way there is a good example of using a y on a surface and that's the uh Jodie Foster very large array I say Jodie Foster because she's in a movie where she talks to aliens through this or something like that but there's a why so there there's a way of thinking about the so there's a culture that does this and at at the at the what you would call or we would call the third dimension we're already looking like this now we want to address all the points in I'd call it ukan space it's the same space XYZ is is about but we're using tuples uh we're using four tuples instead of three tles and we don't need negative numbers here because we've dealt with that issue in a different way it's still got all the same properties however of vector addition linear combination this spans XYZ space you could say everybody get a four number address unique and uh so this is my cue when I get to the books is to jump to a slightly different track so Fuller synergetics what I just showed you the quadr coordinates have all come out since synergetics they're not in this book synergetics and in fact people felt maybe it's a weakness of Fuller's critique of XYZ and cubic Orthodoxy that he didn't have an alternative really to propose and quadres I think he would have been excited about but he didn't live to see them so just wanted to say that now where should we put Fuller historically like going back recently notice I'm segueing on the books we got the postage stamp he's kind of in a way he's an academic but he's also very much a cold warrior I think we can paint him that way without much apology he was military-industrial complex in a way he worked with the military on shelter stuff and here I found something buried in the archives where he's recommending someone to be a contact with hoi Min somebody some journalist some British journalist bu he's saying oh you should send him to Vietnam whatever so I don't know you know I'm not the Super expert on this but I do know that he worked very closely pretty much his whole life with this gentleman Apple White who I talk about and Apple White um knew this guy who's one of the CIA guys and there's Ezra pound and these two corresponded a lot because back at Yale when this guy ran a literary magazine called Orlando he was always being in touch with Ezra pound going over to Italy met him and stuff so there's starting to be a literary flavor to what I'm talking about and also why was Bucky a darling of the Pentagon well because of this is a modern version of what they got into the DU line the early the early warning system about you know monitoring way up North around the Arctic circles to sense what kind of activities might be coming over the horizon from the other side of the earth meaning missiles Jets who knows right so or whe these are called weather stations as well because they're used for civilian purposes so you can say Fuller had this in fact here's I have from um from the trim tab list a recent posting I gave where I found an actual photograph of when one of his domes was in the garden of the Pentagon like at the center surrounded by the five wings or whatever we call them in that Garden they did even put this Dome there at some point now partly why I bring that up is because when I get to coxer and University of Toronto I want to talk about a relationship between coxer and Fuller and I want to mention the pentagon's support of the Bucky patent on the Dome and how this led to some consternation and conflict in a way I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that but so here we are back in 1928 and Fuller's got this for d symbol kind of weird looking the teardrop shape uh Daniel's seen other versions or colored versions recently in the archives and this is way back from 28 and he's throwing his hat in the ring basically as another one who's into this 4D as Meme and 4D there's a lot of ferment at the early 1900s now here we're talking 28 so we're quarter into quarter into it but there's still a lot of thought and talk about about what the fourth dimension means what it's about where is it going with you know it's not that cut and dry let's put it that way and a good way to uh pick up that story is to go back and read uh this book the fourth dimension nonukan geometry and modern art by Linda Del rimple Henderson she does a really good job of tracing the multiple strands multiple schools of thought now i' I'd say there was kind of a ShakeOut over the four of the 1900s and uh they didn't all survive let's say but Fuller had a strong sense of branding he was into self-promotion he didn't want to delegate um how to advertise himself he thought that was the most important thing so he kept tight control over his own publicity aser is going to come into the story but this is the space Fuller was most interested in uh in terms of sphere packing what we call the CCP or FCC or what he called the IVM isotropic Vector Matrix which sounds kind of pretentious and long and so that's why people have a problem with Fuller is because he wrote everything almost it's all in Pros it's not looking it doesn't look tightly mathematical it looks like somebody writing a lot of loquacious verbiage that's maybe not very high quality that's kind of what a lot of people's impression is but I just decided now let's really see what's here but you can see he's uncomfortable he's like that whiny kid or that um rebellious kid in early Elementary School when the teacher draws a DOT on the chalkboard and says this is a point but that's not really a point because Point has no Dimension and you can see this is really a pile of chalk so there's really the point you can't really see it and you know the kid raises their hand and it's like so if I can't really see it how do I know it's there whatever they get into some stupid argument with the teacher right and Fuller is like a guy who continues that argument even even into his 70s and 80s and he doesn't publish synergetics until like 75 with the help of Ed Apple White but he's like he doesn't like this infinitely thin planes right and there's this guy Carl manger I found a logical not a logical positive being a circle guy and he wrote this essay back when Einstein was treated more like a philosopher in those days Einstein was looked up to and it's like this is going to be a philosopher and we're going to study Einstein and philosophy departments now that never really happened he's he's kind of in the physics department philosophy took a different uh attack so you see in the title here it's Albert Einstein philosopher scientist that's kind of like calling the dollar Lama a scientist which some people do but it sounds weird right so geometry of lumps Carl manger in this essay is saying ucl's assumptions about points lines and planes has this two-fold idealization first we don't talk about the extension of the dots or the thickness of the boards and also they all have to be infinite or at least if they start to be long they have to you know what I mean right so he's into Infinity which is fine and he's into Infinity of smallness it's like with the infinite plane comes infinitely thin it's like one over infinity they're both there if you don't want that what if you want a geometry of lumps and also here's push back from Darcy Thompson writing in 1918 to Whitehead and he's having trouble with three-dimensional and why are we saying threedimensional again for space you know who came up with that and you know and he has an Alternatives that I would think it might four dimensional coordinates uh we'll see about that and so geometry of lumps in Fuller this is quoting from synergetics is very much lumpy he's like size is always special case but if you're talking about the Eternal thing it's metaphysical whatever it's not special case it's Timeless it's subfrequency means it only has shape you add frequency you get size you get energy involvement but if you're just talking about the shape of a thing it's all about its angles and a tetrahedron it's really simpler than a cube and it's been too overlooked he's kind of coming to Western civilization and saying I see you you you went with the cube as your most important shape you got these platonics here on the table I I like the cube but what about the tetrahedron here it's simpler it's got fewer vertices all these things why didn't you go with the Tetra what's your reason and you know that starts a discussion I think bit Fuller is triggering and so if I were to teach this morning in high school to jump to the beginning of the show I won't go through the whole thing I'm not going to plot through any of my shows from start to end um here I would usually give some autobiography as well as biography about Fuller um and then I would jump to the books and that's my cue let's go to some other place let's just talk a little bit of History how would I introduce fuller today as an historical figure how would I do that I've shown you sort of connections to Aba white and Ezra pound as kind of tenuous but Ezra pound is a clue it's kind of poets Fuller wanted to be seen as a poet you can find where he says that then he plays a little language game but you're not allowed to call yourself a poet only other people can call you poets so he's like he cites EE Cummings and all this it's like please please I'm a poet but you know it was kind of his revenge because he got expelled from Harvard a couple times but by the end of his life he delivered the Charles Elliot Norton uh lecture um and that's that's kind of a poetic uh position at Harvard anyway anyway so when I tell the story here on the lower left that's Margaret Fuller and that's his Grand great aunt and she's a contemporary of aah Byron and I like to link the two not that they ever met or anything but they're both freethinking women who are totally scholarly I feel bad for a sometimes but she had she her dad her dad was L Lord Byron and they didn't want her to know until she was like 21 and they take her into this room and they pull back this curtain and there's a poor this is your father and she's like whatever teenager it make a good movie anyway continuing there's Margaret Fuller see she was an American transcendentalist so you've got Emerson here uh this is a time when Harvard is turning from Unitarian to transcendentalist you could put it that way with influence from K through Co Ridge and people like that so it's the drift in American philosophy uh to become what we call transcendentalist nii really admired Emerson nii lives later in time he's looking back and okay so here's me I throw myself in I'm much older than that now that's my high school yearbook picture and this gentleman is Sam lanan and he turns out to be the grandson of Zelda and fcot Fitzgerald but he was really into tensegrity and stuff the Bucky was into and I actually went as a personal escort or sort of gopher chaperon somebody to hang with when they went to the Philippines that time as a guest of the Marcos family to Manila Fuller is flying around the world a lot by the time he's this age in this picture and The Coincidence there an interesting coincidence is I would have been a high school student in Manila right about that same time but I wasn't really tracking Bucky then um I hadn't gone Princeton yet and therefore I hadn't read my Vicken Stein yet and I didn't really get into the Bucky stuff until after that anyway but I just wanted to give a little bit of my history and then comes that same slide of Apple White again and here we've got Bucky with Ezra pound towards the end of his life and if you know about Ezra pound in his story he really felt he'd taken a wrong turn a few times because he he ended up in prison right he was put in a mental hospital for 11 years for the stuff he was saying on Italian radio during World War II and he's like well if I'd been in America you would have let me say it because I would have been protected but because I'm in Italy a lot of people wanted him shot right his a very controversial time so I'm just taking back to an older time that probably you either don't know about forgotten about whatever but Ezra pound was very supportive of James Joyce this guy in the middle who caner he's a James Joyce scholar and kind of Fuller's crowd in a way hu caner wrote a biography of Fuller so I'm trying to put Fuller in a literary Circle instead of a science physics Circle even though he totally admired Einstein really looked up to Einstein want to get to that relationship in a minute and here we have Apple White and Fuller in a famous picture on the right the swaave Apple White and that's Donald coxer in the middle I don't have his um picture label or anything and this is Jeffrey Hinton on the left considered the father of machine learning by some the guy who quit Google not so long ago to warn us of the dangers of AI both of these guys are from the University of Toronto in Canada Canada plays a really strong role in development of machine learning Etc artificial intelligence sometimes I play up in fact right now I'll play up kind of the tension then between this sort of imper IST American Buckminster Fuller who has a patent on the geodesic dome and MC esher's son who's immigrated to Canada and is thinking he wants to get into the Dome business now where do I get the story it's from a published book by sioban Roberts called the king of Infinite Space and it's about Donald coxer he's also written a more recent bio of John Conway but in that coxeter book she talks about how how coxer was living angry when he found out that mcer son was being frustrated about getting into the rayome business in other words building those domes across the Arctic Circle like smart young engineer maybe wants to get into that oh but the Pentagon buys all its Bucky domes from Bucky all those geodesic domes there's a patent on that and Cox is like how do you patent the geometry of nature you know this stuff occurs naturally doomes you can find them everywhere in nature and here's some American ego guy in the Pentagon who thinks he owns geodesic domes and he's not going to let MCS so Fuller and Co or coxer develops a view of Fuller that he might not like Fuller and I'm saying this relationship evolves over time by the time coxer sees the Montreal Pavilion in 1967 he feels better about Bucky it's like this really is beautiful architecture and this is a message of world peace and all this kind of stuff and their their relationship continues to evolve but I'll never say it was very comfortable but I also want to say uh for the record that um let me get to this important slide I'm I'm almost I'm going forward now through all this see the content of synergetics just to to to alert you to that is very geometric so I'm calling it a philosophical work in the humanities I'm circling all that kind of stuff as you've seen but then when we actually start looking at the pictures at the figures it's all very geometric right and in gist what it's about is it's saying I'd really like this tetrahedron embedded inside a cube to be my unit of volume I'd really like that but that's never going to happen because the cube we're embedded in is second root of two on the edge so obviously the whole volume of this cube is 2ot of two to the 3 power that's the volume of the cube and there's a well-known theorem that the tetrahedron inscribed in a cube is a third the volume of that cube right that's not Fuller that's just general proved knowledge in Geometry so if you're ever going to have that tetrahedron be volume one the cube has to have volume three and it clearly doesn't because the edges are second root of two and second root of 2 to the3 power is second root of 2 to the3 power it's some crazy irrational numb so what are you talking about Mr Bucky Fuller well he's saying I'm going to change the Meaning of Third and second power it's a growing tetrahedron that grows 18 2764 over here and so when you raise something to the third power picture a growing tetrahedron at that point and so I'm going to grow my tetrahedron this one inside here um using using this alternative model and therefore my cube is going to have a different volume it's not going to be we're no longer going to use the right angle to determine what we mean by third power and so here you see a quote where he's saying schooled people all think of length breadth and height as these three separate things like oh I can imagine height without widths oh there's widths no height okay swap them okay now they're height you know what's the difference can you really imagine them separately and floor is saying no let's not do that let's just have one space to rule them all and let's have the tetrahedron be its icon and not the cube and it has four faces very four very pronounced four you can get three out of it by drawing Z's along the edges and stuff one two three you get a z two Z's make a tetrahedron there's your three-dimensional intuition but really instead of going with the cube people let's just start over start fresh and have our tetrahedron be 40 so when you come to synergetics it's kind of like you're in search of the fourth dimension but you're thinking 3d+ one where's the fourth and in this world you say here's all four this is a four-dimensional space but you just can't keep your other three you're trading your car in for another car your one two 3 whatever that's gone it's all 4D it's all tetrahedron all the way down everything's a tetron right but that doesn't bring time into it we got to have rotation we got to have change but kind of an estatic sense when you do that when your tetrahedron unit volume your octahedron with the same Edge length as volume four your uh space filling romic Doc andedon is volume six now that's with the long diagonal of each face the diamond faces 12 of them they have long and short diagonals crisscross long diagonals same as the edge of the tetraedron volume six now these ratios are all there in XYZ we're not changing the math these these ratios are there but they're not they're not teased out because our unit volume is the cube and the cube does not play well with others compared to the tetrahedron and there's the cube voline three so we have a different meaning of powering we have an alternative is very alien so I call this Martian math sometimes when I teach it to kids so this is how the Martian s you never learned this in school right but check it out so now that tedin is volume one we can section it up to fractional tetrahedron there's one called the a module and then there's another one called the B module that sits on top of the a module and those two together if you take the left and right a and add a left or right B can make What's called the M which is a space spilling tetraedron you may have heard that tetrahedra don't fill space well that's true of the regular tetrahedon but the various irregular tetrahedra um that do fill space and this is where Fuller overlaps with I would say everyday conventional math on the left side is a page out of a math journal Journal of combinatorial theory and this is about these are the plane Nets of tetrahedra that do in fact fill space and along the bottom there are the names they have if we were in the name space of synergetics and the edges all match because edges don't tell you I mean you you can expand it the shape is all that really matters here okay so the the the last thing back to the quadrate coordinates is how do we support this intuition that space is four-dimensional with something like the X XYZ coordinates so imagine you're in high school school I'm talking to you and you've just learned a lot about XYZ I show you this Jack you say yeah that's what we've been learning about the XYZ coordinate system looks like a Jack it's got the positive and negative of each of those three number lines blah blah and what we're using now over on the right is the Cal trop instead in a way you see it's more economical it's got fewer spokes after all right I mean everyone wants to say three-dimensional is the simp simp world but when you look at the apparatus that comes with the XYZ it's not as simple as the Caltrop so you know let's at least question it let's take it check it out let's go further so the thing is we can build the XYZ coordinates from the quadray it's not an either or thing and that's the important aspect of all of this is that synergetics does not negate the old normal way of thinking XYZ is here to stay where always going to have that I'd call it the Mahayana of math the Hilbert space math ukian math the E that I talked about back in the beginning here so where are we in my talk quad Rays I have quad Rays implemented in Python so students can download them and play with them interactively what that looks like using today's technology is something called Jupiter notebooks so here's like the source code for Quadrant Ray and you have also source code for tetrahedrons right I can express the vertices of tetrahedrons using quadratic coordinates if I like or I can convert back to XYZ doesn't matter either way I have lengths like distances and those are the same between XYZ and IVM coordinates but I change how I compute volume because as you saw my third powering is no longer your third powering when I say your I mean XYZ people you XYZ people you use a cube to to say third powering and you always say three cubes you don't stop to think that that could have been a tetrahedron at some point in history it's too late now let's say synergetics will never be popular because we've already made our choice let's put it that way but had we gone this route what would it have been like what would the math have been like that's an interesting question to ask and so we CH the way we compute volume I'll show you quickly I take a well-known formula from history and one that's not known at all this guy named pirod DEA franccesca in the 1400s just give me the six lengths of a tetrahedron and I'll give you back the volume through this complicated computation I'll do just give me the lengths I'll give you the volume same deal from Kaye manger that's our same manger this uses a determinant and same deal from Gerald deang except nobody knows about this one and he's lost his derivation but I used it for years so I have these three different ways of taking the six edges of a tetrahedron and returning the volume in what are called Tetra volumes so we're no longer using unit cubes when we talk about what is the volume of x or y or shape a and shape B we're talking about the Petra volumes thereof so this slide deck is all about quadrates and their use so this I'll leave at this picture and see if there's questions at this point so here excuse me here we are using quadrate coordinates in the isotropic vector Matrix which has kind of a scaffolding role just like XYZ does and I'm saying two * 2 * 5 equals 20 what do I mean by that I just take the tips of those three vectors 2 * 2 * 5 and close the lid I just you know add the fourth face and say that volume is equal to 20 of those little unit tetrahedrons now you'll notice this whole scaffolding is not solely made of unit tetrahedrons It's a combination of tetrahedrons and octahedrons why he patented as the octet trust again the Imperial American patenting the geometry of nature how dare he but what he was trying to show was hey I'm being pretty effective here I devoted my life to helping people and wow I'm getting all these patents wow look at me I'm pretty cool so there's s his side of it there too as to why he was so always trying to take credit for his thoughts because he was trying to prove a point which is if you commit your life the way he did to serving all humanity and that's why he was different as a cold warrior he never really took the side of either the Russians or the Americans he's like let me show you both how you can improve things and so you know that's a positive futurism he was a positive futurist and those are in uh high demand so to get real sophisticated because you guys are math people if you take it at permanent you just take the quadray of Four Points in space so remember quadray I don't think it's a Hilbert space because there's no right angles to the coordinates there's four tipples you lie them side down you lie them down the four coordinate uh the four positions of any Tetra uh these are the four vertices of any tetrahedron compute this determinant take 1/4 of that and you get your IVM volume your tetrahedral volume of that uh tape and interestingly and I demonstrate this in Python for my high school audience if you pick any four Spears in a closest packed beer uh ocean the IVM Pi any four sphere that at random connect them with the six edges and ask for the Tetra volume you always get a whole number interesting in this slide I'm showing how once you understand about quad Rays you can input the corners of what we call the a module shown in this picture there's the B module uh as quad Rays like the vertices are entered as quad rays and then we feed it to the formula I just showed you it constructs that determinant and computes the volume but the volume comes out what 124th because our unit of volume again is a tetrahedron you got to live in a world where the cube of unit edges does not have a rational volume oh my God oh my God so my view is as a liberal Vicken Stein kind of guy both these worlds coexist Nam spaces coexist it's not a big deal that floor is over here on the side with his subculture evolving this whole different way of thinking talking that uses a lot of the same words because in the end we all want to use the same words you'll find philosophers who say things like if you don't mean what I mean by gravity then you should be saying schav right we get to use the fun the real word right but what I'm saying in in my slides here is we all want to use the word Vector so what I have this little acronym is like everyone wants to rule the world we none of us want to deny ourselves access to these key words and the way we solve that in Python is we create what are called namespaces they selled it in Java as well but it's a way to create sandboxes where we all get to use the same words but we don't have to mean the same thing there's no one namespace to rule them all we didn't need that we don't have it okay that ends my talk so and away yall can ask anything I got the chure cat in there the thing about Dimensions is when we say they don't exist independently of each other that's the kind of the critique going back to that slide we're saying you can't have height without depth like can you I mean the the book flatland has been very very very influential and we convince ourselves that we can be two-dimensional in that but what is that really like aren't you looking down if you're looking down on a square you're not you're in space you're looking down on a piece of paper so forget that you know you can't actually collapse what i' call res extensa into two Dimensions experientially this is what Fuller is saying it's all there all at once and if you start from there how does it get to be three and not four and so for for it's an odd feel that somebody would debate you that when you say space is three-dimensional what we're used to is take that for granted duh we we learned that in elementary school and now you have adults coming in the room and saying well what we we're going to say four-dimensional because we like the Tet region more than a cube it's like that's weird not used to that but I would say therefore make it be seem like an Asian thing I use Sanskrit here dependent origination all the dimensions are there at once you can't have one without the other there's no height without breaths anyway that's kind of the rhetoric you want a sample and my my what I'm saying is you can you don't have to give up on any of these you can always switch between them none of them are going anywhere it's not like oh which is right which Camp am I in do I have to be a champion of one or the other it's no you I use machine learning I love the 3D stuff I teach that stuff so these are the three name spaces I'm talking about and just to recap the relationships Fuller really admired Einstein and wanted to write a book about Einstein called it nine chains to the moon and this is early before the atomic bombs this before Oppenheimer and Einstein everyone's endeared with this Einstein guy including Fuller but it's doesn't have the ominousness yet and Fuller writes kind of a light-hearted book called Nine chains to the Moon with which got Arthur C Clark's attention at some point and and they say to full look you're nobody what are you writing about Einstein you got to be a genius to write about Einstein there's about five people in the world who are allowed to write about Einstein who do you think you are so Fuller took the uh not to be so easily discouraged he sent his manuscript to Einstein and he got a call and he gets to go to Einstein and there's this play about Bucky Fuller it's a monologue play one actor does the whole thing but the scene where he's ushered in and he gets to sit down with Einstein it's like Fuller is Star Struck and Einstein is like young man you surprise me I never thought there'd be anything like practical or interesting to say about my work you know in the everyday world but here you shown blah blah and you have my blessing so Fuller got to be on the list of people who could write those kind of books it's not very technical it's you know n to the Moon he later he was drinking a lot of time when he wrote that but it's a really pretty interesting book so the relationship between coxer and Einstein I'm saying given three people here let's sketch their relationships uh coxer is at pains in this quote to say um my way of doing 4D extended ukian ism is not the same as Einstein's let's not confuse them and I don't think enough is done to help coxer make this point a lot of people would not identify extended ukian ISM with coxer in particular I mainly do that because University of Toronto but also because um Fuller dedicates his energetics to coxer so i' I've I've used that in my shop talk to use the name coxis to stand for Gilbert space ukian extended ukan any number of Dimensions whatever ND geometry and he's saying this is not the same as what Einstein's doing with manowski space stuff like that so he's eager to make the distinction and what I'm saying is once you take him at his word that those two are different then you've realized that 4D can appear in these two whole different name spaces and mean completely different things and that can be very confusing to a lay person if they've not encountered the doctrine of namespaces now thankfully they're learning Python and droves it's getting easier for people to tease apart the fact that when I say vector or God or something it may not be in the same name space as what you're used to so and then so once I've got room for two it's easier to wedge in Fuller and say yeah but he published late people didn't learn about him and so that's why he's very obscure until you came to our very elite school in Silicon Forest where we do teach this stuff we kind of make fun of other people who don't right uh there my bookshelves as current so I just took these pictures recently you can see I've got a little bit of category Theory there with Changs book you know I'm studying that language because I kind of want to know how this can be translated into category three the so-called Beast modules b a s those are just tetrahedral wedges I've already shown you the A and the B this is the S the S Nestles between the oct Hedon of volume four and it's contained icosahedron and they 24s modules added to that icosahedron gives you the octahedron again this nesting relationship is not new with bucky bucky is basically saying don't just throw the polyhedra out on a table unrelated to each other their full dactic value comes from converging them into some kind of nest and a lot of people have had that Insight it's not enough to have polyhedra you want to see how they relate to each other so we do that we have this concentric hierarchy of polyhedra so there's the S modules in terms of a plane net again this is directly from synergetics but when we compute the volume of it we're not using standard XYZ math we're using what I showed you other earlier so there's the lengths and when I get out the volume it's going to fit in our volumes table and we can express that volume the volume in Tetra volumes of the S module is 5^ the5 over two so we have a very five based very interesting there's the S module 3D printed f up that's s and then edges expanded by five so volume up to the third power so the Beast modules is where we are and here's our volumes table overall right so of the Ted region is one and I'm using very high Precision not just floating point and I'm using actual algebraic expressions out on the right so redin is valued differently all the volumes have a different value but there's a constant ratio between them called the synergetics constant so when you go from the XYZ world to the IVM world all that changes is somehow the model of third powering and then all your volumes shift but by a constant value so it's it's really very very simple this is not stuff that's partly why it can fly in say High School level but there might be a way to introduce category Theory let these modules these these uh wedges morph into each other the a turns into the B these a b and t by the way all have the same volume one over 24 and then there's the E and the S those are the four of five modules tetral wedges that we study once we've absorbed a little Paradigm of unit volume tetrahedron concentric hierarchy like that then we break the tetrahedron into pieces shatter some other stuff and we get these vocabulary of five basic wedges and I kind of showed you how two of them the A and the B can be used to make the M which is one of the space filling tetrahedra known to Conventional XYZ math world but VI a different name well it's a lot about n nomenclature who who dares to call the a module an a module and can we call it something else if we're not interested in getting Fuller's name and further circulation we must stop use of a to mean this a module and so forth thank you Kirby yeah Shana or Dean go for it first Dean away if you want you want me to go oh you go first okay yeah Kirby just uh thank you so much for that incredible talk yeah I we could start some uh categorical synergetic um you know thinkings um I had a question if you go back to the geometry of lumps slide sure where that was um just have to make the right slide deck yeah down I'm almost there that one uh let's see I think um more with a systematic character of prime thinkability where's that one this one oh you have the actual like 107 1.0 the kind of Fuller slide oh a fuller slide got it okay this one yeah it's it's it says geometry of lumps in the first thing okay I got you prime thinkability yep yep yep no you're right on totally good memory very cool all right um no I know that's not it let's just go one by one I can tell ask it without the thing if you want yeah there okay cool um so since you're like a you know a fuller expert I want to ask if you can the systematic realization slide um where he says all Imaging derives from experience so since we're sitting here talking about math art fronts I want to know what you think that what you think that is what you think uh he's doing with that could you have an image without an experience because he's adding frequency to what he calls the um you know mathematical UND demonstrable something so just wondering what you what's your take on all imageing derives from experience well I think if we took away what you couldn't get from experience like we can extrapolate from experience we like people say I can experience a perfect circle and then you close your mind or close your eyes and say I'm doing it right now I'm now picturing A Perfect Circle and it's like there's no one really there to contradict you or there's no peer review in that sense um I'm thinking he means public he means we all get our private Authority from shared public space so if you think you see something that's totally non-experiential how are you going to communicate it and at some point it becomes experiential it's like our experience in math is very strong right it's it's not like we don't feel and and sense right so that's experiential too so when I say experiential it's not about discount other than visualization which he assoc Associates by the way with Oiler he he Associates the spatial visual imaginary you could call that oian and just for fun to try that on and then the visceral like when you just tactile feel like your emotions you can almost say that he Associates with with Gibbs Tech tactile vectorial energy flows of that kind of being on a roller coaster visceral sense anyway just extrapolating it's a language partly why it's two volumes and there's also a synergetics dictionary four volumes all done with help from Apple White who would collate everything Bucky said because he did have I would say kind of unmowed meanings for his words not just frequency not just what you're reading here but when he talks about radiation and gravity it's like you say wait a minute this is your own private language isn't it and in a way yeah in a way it is it is that's partly yeah Daniel yeah on that quote just a few possible active inference connections all Imaging derives from experience so that's kind of like the projective Consciousness or the screen type visualizations that we've been discussing and then also the next line I think points towards cognitive modeling because it's saying you can abstract you can abstract to negative dimension 0 1 2 3 you can think slash do anything however that experience will be a cognitive systematic situation so that's kind of an embodied or a historical approach to math operations which is like yes a mathematician can imagine an infant desmal as the basis of continuity and a line they can and they're not wrong within that namespace world however that is how happening on the organism's cognitive interface I think because of my Vicken Stein background again later Vicken Stein it it's not required for a term to be meaningful for it to have a reference so that it actually points to something so you can have a language that's chalk full of meaning and yet it doesn't really point to anything and I take my analogy of driving a car the steering wheel is as much part of the language game as the signage the striped lines everything about the road in fact where language begins and everything else ends there's no line so it's all just you know language you could say the whole car everything and that's kind of an operational view of language and in that sense I don't say well you know no really the job is to line up your words with the essence of things you know that's kind of the western metaphysics is if we dig down deep enough we'll find the essence of the word logic or the essence of the word Dimension and it's our job to find that and in a Vicken steinan sense know it's our job to create language games that hold together until they don't right it's like name spaces come and go like sand castles on the beach right it's like it's not necessary to decide which one is quote true right they forms of life so that's why I'm thinking when I talk about these branches and different uses of the word Dimension and so on I'm I'm I'm saying you know there's friendships here coxer and Bucky ended up being friends Einstein and Bucky admired each other I'm sure coxer admired Einstein there's nothing to keep us as human beings from jumping around between these but it's a little difficult to do because of the required gestal shifts when you jump from say XYZ apparatus into IVM coordinates and go from three tles to four tles it's can be jarring right but then after a while it gets smooth right I think it helps understand XYZ to to jump into quadrates for example I I don't see them as uh I don't see one as hurting the other I see them as two apis to the same means and what I didn't show just real quick is once we are using quadres we can get whole number coordinates for all the Spheres in closest packing so I start with a nuclear ball I do a layer of 12 around it a layer of 42 around that another layer of 92 another layer of 162 as I grow this outward creating the CCP uh I can just use 12 permutations of my original basis vectors in other words once you start with a quad raise take two of one one of any other two and none of a third a fourth and do all 12 permutations of that and you now have the Hops you need to the neighboring spheres around the sphere you're in the 12 around one and linear combinations of those directions therefore on the right you see all whole number integer positive integer addressing for CCP space whereas in XYZ we don't have it it's not that nice so there are practical uses for this I would say graphic arts people really need to know about the concentric hierarchy adding quadr for example if you just add um three of you add triples of quadres you get the opposite tetrahedron right you get the inverse intersected duel The tetran Duel of itself you can get the cubes vertices from the quadres uh because you've got the Dual tetrahedron so those two together make a cube same octahedron Ric DotA in other words this diagram on the right says it all a through A through Z all those points can be reached with very simple sums of the Quadra and I feel like when we jump into the swimming pool we come out smarter and we're better able to understand XYZ as well thank you Kirby Dean and Jim well thanks Daniel um I have a question for you um around it's it's a bit of a fork from some of the stuff that you have in the slides here I'm I'm wondering around the learning aspect of four-dimensional um awareness and and understanding and acknowledgement there's a lot there are a lot of relationships out there I'm sure I have a relationship with the fish swimming around in the lake in front of my my cabin right now but I don't necessarily acknowledge that until I bump into them or whatever and I think a lot of learning um centers on what we choose to acknowledge and what we just ignore or it's put in the background right so this isn't a we're all related we're all one kind of thing of course we are but the learning is in what matters in that particular situation or context in which we're trying to expand our or maybe um contract our mod model right so my question um is around the idea that that the synergetics forks off of Relativity or you know is in that Rel still in that relationship forward Dimension and less Bucky the Savior and more Bucky The Man by not taking a math or art I.E a cold war side as relationship was Bucky a bit of a turd disturber what was that a turd disturber yeah I'm trying to be I'm trying to be polite Kirby I I think he was a Maverick and he did stir the pot and he was controversial and he caused a lot of um there's still to this day all kinds of controversy swirling around Fuller I think the only way to explain why something is straightforward and interesting as I just went through is so esoteric and unknown has to be more than just oh I'm going to ignore it I think no I'm going to actively suppress it I'm not saying you I'm just saying Fuller felt this himself that he was going to be forgotten in a hurry and I think it was partly because of that way he played the Cold War he was not taking sides and that he doesn't make you popular even today right so he he had enemies detractors and like Kenneth snelson if you're into the lore you know about that rivalry just real quick I think people need to deal with my story more and I've got you know I've got this could seem self-serving but I get more into where I put myself in the picture here calman Ry stuff like that fits into Bucky stuff I'm saying I was Kenneth Nelson's first Web Master I was also the buck Mr Fuller's first Web Master master so like here we are in the Next Generation if you want to write about book another book about synergetics you should talk to me right because there's all these books coming out still where they don't even mention the Beast modules and my feeling is the Boomers skipped Bucky like they went to his lectures and they applauded and oh nice pat on the head you're a good guy you want the world to be a better place but we're not going to pay any attention to the mathematic and I'm I'm one of the Boomers but I'm telling downline Generations I think my fellow Boomers made a mistake this was worth keeping and I think my downliners get that so this art by Casey house is not by me but we're gonna have a a good cultural Renaissance as people recover the Damage Done by the uh the Boomers so can I just do a quick followup Kirby then we are looking at things as math art and we are not picking sides should we anticipate that there are going to be a whole bunch of people out there who are gonna pounce on this and hate no no I don't think I think we're past that now that might have been true at one point but I don't think we're in that time now I think this stuff will smoothly gain traction but in general though I do think art isn't neutral in other words propagandists on all sides use the tools of art to persuade art is a tool of persuasion as well as just isn't this pretty so you know I I I I pay attention to that but I think Fuller's stuff right now is in good shape like we're not worried right maybe at one point point but this stuff you know I get to teach this I'm online a lot people love it it's like I'm not having much push pushback so if that answers it all like I'm not encountering any vicious anger myself as I push forward seems like the coast is clear come on in the water's fine and we need more math Talent OR art Talent like like Casey house here I can't do anything this pretty my animations it's not like it's just me but like I sense a lack of good computer Graphics still around a lot of this stuff so I'm recruiting I'm in recruit mode hey if you're listening and you want to help bring your art skills over here and help us that kind of thing keep our 4D alive in this lineage right I love all of these they're all good I didn't put put s ahead for any reason I wasn't trying to mean anything just trying to make room here and I'm not saying these are the only branches or anything like that I'm just saying here's a triangle we can make you can forget about synergetics it's not important if you want to take there'll be enough people so if you don't want to jump on the boat don't feel coerced is another message while I have the floor thank you again it's not or I'm a I'm a teacher of ordinary XYZ math a lot right I I was a calculus teacher so quickly like uh I grew up in Portland Oregon my dad's an urban planner but he always wants to work overseas not in the highly developed first world so to speak he's trained as a PhD planner at the University of Chicago wants to work overseas in quote developing countries so even though we were settling down in Portland Oregon for a cushy middle class lifestyle when the call came how'd you like to work in Libya he's like yeah that's what I'm for uh let's go now that turned out to be cushy anyway because the family gets to live in Italy and Rome so I grow up in Rome through 8th grade go to high school in the Philippines go to Princeton East Coast for a while and now I'm back in Portland Oregon so I'm kind of expat and uh my dad was freelance so sometimes he worked for the US government and sometimes not he was on the payroll of the Egyptians when they lived in Cairo for years so after I left the family ship as I say they were in the Philippines I go to Princeton they keep moving around so my parents live in Cairo for many years they end up in Bhutan in the Himalayas and I go stay with them there for many years so I have an interesting bio and I I play that card like I want people to use my like we use Bucky's life Bucky knew a lot of people he was very gregarious and he didn't mind writing letters to whoever so a new book about Bucky called um inventor of the future by Alec Naval I see we're about at time here so let me just end it's a really good bio and Alec is kind of a skeptic he's not a um an acolyte he's not doing geography for Bucky this book is a skeptical look at Bucky and I think that's fine what it really shows though is how can use this life as a guide book to the 20th century and a lot of intellectual history will unfold so I guess what I'm saying is I thank the mathematicians for looking in on what we're doing but a lot of what I'm doing here is prepping kids in American history right they need to know transcendentalists how it goes towards Bucky and you know all this stuff's literature whether you get it in math class or not but I'd like you to get it in math class and I'd like math class to use Python because I don't think we should be teaching math without a computer but that's just me I have a whole other stick on that thank you Kirby Jim last question thanks Kirby for talk and um I want to ask you a question so um if tetraedron is the basis unit for a 4D system then um what do you think the 5D system will be or even higher Dimension that's great question in Fuller's own synergetics and this is partly why I say he branches off Einstein more than off of coxer or off of extended idanis is Fuller immediately turns to talk of time when he considers Fifth Dimension sixth Dimension he does want the word Dimension to continue to do work in his synergetics and he's got lots of passages using that word at one point though there's a passage where he says this word Dimension I'm paraphrasing is just too slippery I'm not going to use it anymore I'm going to use the word power and then he starts doing stuff with power right after that and that's very interesting passage but he has what I call New Year's resolutions in his writing where he resolves pounds of table I'm never going to say polyhedrin again it's GNA be poly verxion from now on yeah right you know New Year's resolution but your question is um tell me again if the tetri regions the basis yeah what would be um the Bas Fifth Dimension you know for for you guys let me say you guys in a I don't mean to to box you in but as Hilbert space extended ukian because this is a path you're on and after this talk your talks will continue on that path I think um what's a 4D Tesseract in other words what's a tetrahedron in 4D I do the same thing I do with a cube right I draw a smaller one inside a bigger one and connect the corners and what do I call that if a tesseract is a 4D Cube what do I call a 40 tetrahedron and why XYZ people isn't that tetrahedron important to you in other words you really into that Tesseract why not the tetrahedron and it's 4D version what does it look like why don't you talk about that more because the tetrahedron is clearly simpler than the cube you're way too into the cube that's you know coming from an alien way out their view thank you Kirby Dean Jim shenna been fun all right a very appropriate and I hope you guys all stay in touch and we keep working on this we need help thank you thanks till math r five thank you bye for
