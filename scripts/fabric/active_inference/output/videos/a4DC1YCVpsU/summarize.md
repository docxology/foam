# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The presentation explores how geometric constraints influence human brain function, emphasizing the relationship between brain structure and dynamics.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The brain's structure significantly constrains its function, similar to other systems in nature.
2. Historical debates between neuroscientists Kahal and Golgi shaped modern understanding of brain anatomy.
3. The neuron Doctrine established the brain's organization at a cellular level, emphasizing discrete units.
4. Different scales of brain organization range from cellular to macro levels in understanding connectivity.
5. Eigenmodes from structural properties can explain brain dynamics and functional connectivity observed via MRI.
6. Geometric modes derived from T1-weighted images outperform other anatomical modes in reconstructing brain activity.
7. Long-wavelength patterns dominate brain activation maps, challenging traditional focal activation analysis.
8. Neural field theory suggests continuous wave-like propagation of brain activity rather than discrete signaling.
9. The model's simplicity allows for broader application across different species and conditions in neuroscience.
10. Future research aims to integrate complex connectivity into wave models to better understand brain dynamics.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding brain function requires a balance between geometric properties and complex connectivity.
2. The geometric approach simplifies analysis and is applicable across diverse brain studies.
3. Long-wavelength modes capture essential brain activity patterns often missed in traditional analysis.
4. Future models should incorporate heterogeneity in cortical areas to enhance understanding of dynamics.
5. The research opens avenues for exploring brain function across species and in various neurological conditions.
