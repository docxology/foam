# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Robert Warden discusses the requirement equation in cognition, emphasizing its role in understanding brain functionality and fitness.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The requirement equation focuses on what brains need to do, not how they do it.
2. It serves as a mathematical benchmark for evaluating cognitive models and fitness.
3. The equation is related to Bayesian theory but includes additional terms.
4. Animals do not compute the requirement equation due to its complexity.
5. A gray box model assumes brains compare actions to choose the best outcome.
6. The requirement equation can analyze decision-making across various environments.
7. Brains evolve towards maximizing fitness based on the requirements defined by the equation.
8. Internal models may be necessary in complex domains but not in simpler ones.
9. The analysis can help refine active inference models based on fitness gaps.
10. Future discussions will focus on 3D spatial cognition and neural representations.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the requirement equation can enhance cognitive modeling and empirical research.
2. The distinction between Bayesian cognition and internal models is crucial for complex decision-making.
3. Natural selection pressures significantly influence cognitive evolution and functionality.
4. Collaborative and independent evolution of traits can impact brain functionality and adaptability.
5. The requirement equation provides a framework for comparing actual behavior to theoretical models.
