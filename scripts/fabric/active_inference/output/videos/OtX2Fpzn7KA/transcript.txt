[Music] thank you [Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome this is active live stream number 49.0 we're discussing the paper a worked example of the Bayesian mechanics of classical objects welcome to the active inference Institute we're a participatory online Institute that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference this is recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams head over to activeinference.org to learn more about participating in different projects and learning groups at The Institute well we're here today in live stream number 49.0 where we're providing some background in context for the paper a worked example of the Bayesian mechanics of classical objects this paper was submitted to the archive preprint server in June 2022 and we're going to be discussing and looking at a slightly revised version that was uploaded earlier this month on the 6th of September it's a single author paper by Dalton a r sakh diva devel and this video um although all dot zeros are this one is two it's an introduction and just a preliminary discussion of some of the ideas it's not a review or a synthesis or a final word and we'll explain a little bit more about our DOT zero approach in a couple of slides but suffice to say that with Jacob Ali and also under we had a great time over the last two months really pulling back and trying to think deeply about how to frame this paper and really this whole area of research and development because there's a lot happening there's a lot being tied together and so we hope that some of that sense making translates into the ways that we've laid out 49.0 and we're very much looking forward to having Dalton join for the dot one and the dot two so Dalton thanks for all the work and for listening to this dot zero let's head to introductions and warm-ups so we can just say hello and any other features of what we're excited about in this discussion I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I think there's a lot that is exciting about this paper I didn't have much of a physics background before heading towards active inference in the free energy principle so taking a first look at a lot of these physics ideas was interesting like seeing them as part of something that already could or had been integrated rather than starting with the puzzle pieces I think was a little bit interesting and I'll pass to Ali hi I'm Ali I'm an independent researcher from Iran actually what gravitated me towards active inference paper this I mean fep were active in Prince literature and particularly this paper was uh you see I was always uh I've been fascinated by uh doing uh the the kind of elegant abstractions and uh and some physical Concepts or some uh doing uh a kind of bird's-eyed view over uh the the methodological way of doing uh physical modeling and uh I believe this paper and the other related papers uh offered by uh Dalton secretable and the other and his other colleagues from versus lab uh are the epitome of uh this kind of uh fep abstraction in terms of uh elegantly formalizing all the rigorous mathematical foundations of it and uh yeah that's why I'm pretty excited to be here actually it's been a very fascinating and thrilling Journey during the past couple of months since we began discussing this paper and so I'm very much looking forward to it foreign I'm a student and researcher in the UK um there are also many uh okay lost Jacob for a second we'll just wait we'll take a breath okay it's all good oh where was I cut off just start at the beginning maybe turn off your video okay c'est la vie okay your backyard cup just start at the beginning it's all good okay uh sorry I got randomly disconnected uh so hello I'm jakub I'm a student uh and researcher in the UK uh I'm really I was really excited about this paper specifically coming from uh physics background which I must say didn't help that much in initially understanding the paper on the on the first pass uh but I think it's really exciting um that this kind of unification of physics and cognitive Sciences uh is formed through uh works like uh this paper or prior work um that Carl friston colleagues have been working on and I am really excited about how this work might um influence the future Synergy of physics and cognitive Sciences or neurosciences which uh I think previously were quite disjoint Fields but now uh with the uh more Focus towards like complexity scientists were seeing these uh similar patterns across a wide range of topics which I find really exciting so really looking forward to the discussion and the rest of the live stream great great thanks so we're going to go to the big question Ames claims abstract and roadmap and then before we head off on that road trip and we find together we're going to pull back to our approach and set a lot of context and that'll be most of this dot zero video and then we'll briefly touch on some points from the paper but most of this video is going to be actually in that context setting there's a lot of big questions that can be asked and one of them is quite simply what is Bayesian mechanics but to make that a little bit more operational we could ask what is the relevance of Bayesian mechanics what is mechanical about cognitive science are we talking about physical mechanisms underlying cognitive agents or are we talking about something else it's the second what is of epistemic and pragmatic value about Bayesian mechanics if we're going to be using active inference in the free energy Principle as the gripper and the gripped then how can we understand what is valuable and relevant in salience in terms of active inference ways of thinking about it what would you fellows add what felt like really big questions that would lead somebody to want to be exploring this paper yeah Ali well actually uh before talking about the specific pragmatic value of doing Bayesian mechanics I think what at least in my view what's really interesting about uh basically a mechanical way of doing these kind of uh probabilistic formulations and mathematical modeling is just it's pure Elegance in okay pick up again from Pure different elements I mean sorry Ali pick up from Pure Elegance okay uh yeah as I was saying uh I think uh one of its main interests is its pure Elegance in unifying uh the different approaches to fep in a kind of uh all-encompassing uh framework called am Bayesian mechanics by which uh it can possibly uh I mean the other uh Frameworks and other viewpoints and even other kinds of mechanics can be recovered so uh at least for me personally this is the most interesting part and exciting part of uh doing Bayesian mechanics but I'm sure there will be much pragmatic value and much more applications that can potentially derive from the this kind of viewpoint awesome where's Beauty and elegance in epistem and pragma Jakob um I definitely agree with with Ali's point and maybe to add to that I think it's really elegant that within Bayesian mechanics you have a unifying formalism with which you can recover much of the same loss that we see in classical physics um also we can also uh talk about the quantum mechanics as being um enclosed within the Bayesian mechanic formalism but at the same time using the same uh those same Concepts we can also model systems which are not usually considered by physics like uh autonomous agents or but any biological entity and that I think will be one of the probably one of the most relevant parts or contributions of of Bayesian mechanics awesome Beauty as um and in Elegance as uh indicators of scope and scale so the paper is a worked example of the Bayesian mechanics of classical objects we've mentioned some details about it before I'll just highlight um a few claims some coming earlier in the middle and later in the paper so earlier in the paper it's written it's often claimed that the free energy principle is as simple in general as the principle of stationary action and that is a citation to a paper that we're going to discuss in just a few slides simpler but not too simple and it's claimed about the fep that it can be sketched out how Bayesian mechanics of internal states of classical objects might look and that's a citation to friston 2019 free energy principle for a particular physics which we're also going to look at nevertheless there's yet to be a systematic investigation of even the Bayesian mechanics of classical physics despite it being readily available due to recent formulations as a leased action principle so we've talked a lot about on these streams and elsewhere about the free energy Principle as a variational principle of least action for cognitive systems so there was an opportunity that Dalton identified which is to make a systematic investigation of classical physics and provide worked examples towards the middle of the paper there are some important aims such as we began with the aim of showing that classical physics can be derived from Bayesian mechanics so we'll work with different metaphors and ways of exploring it but this is not like a layer two on physics this is a generalization that in special cases includes classical statistical thermodynamic and quantum mechanics we can derive Bayesian mechanics from the idea that a system is classical on average just as we can derive classical mechanics from the idea that systems obey Bay Bayesian Mechanics for classical averages we're going to unpack that later but it's a key claim and then later in the paper there is the aim to eventually formulate chaotic or itinerant systems under Bayesian mechanics as has been done for earlier forms of the free energy principle and that's kind of what the paper is going to be leading towards and suggesting for future work including that of G Theory anything that you fellows would add all right um could somebody read the abstract uh yeah but before going to into abstract I wanted to point out uh one of the main goals of the paper I think uh would be uh there are a couple of new results in this paper that uh wasn't introduced as far as I know in the previous uh literature one of which is uh the derivation of classical physics from the principle of constraint maximum entropy and the reintroduction of supersymmetry as an explanation for uh classical chaos as indicated on page five of the paper uh so I think this is in some way uh this paper is a kind of expanded footnote to the previous papers but also adding some new results uh I mean it's very important appendix to that paper by making uh some of the theoretical claims of specifically on Bayesian mechanics paper more concrete so yeah I just wanted to point that out as well great great point this should be of interest to people who are following the development and applications of active inference and free energy principle but it will become clear that the scope is very Broad and people even outside of what might be perceived as just this community will hopefully find interest and apply scrutiny and continue the conversation with us so somebody May read the abstract sure uh so Bayesian mechanics is a new approach to studying the mathematics and physics of interacting stochastic processes here we provide a worked example of a physical Mechanics for classical objects which derives from a simple application thereof we summarize the current state of the art of Bayesian mechanics in doing so we also give a sketch of its connections to classical chaos owing to a particular n equals to supersymmetry short and sweet to the roadmap all right so the paper begins with uh I'm putting us our video over the the top fellow on this uh stack so the paper begins with an introduction and then dives into the concept of mechanics which we'll be talking more about the subsections there are covering classical physics in one dimension the basics of Bayesian mechanics a physics of beliefs and then a physics by beliefs which is going to be kind of taking us into this cognitive lens then a general equation equation 15 or Bayesian classical mechanics is presented and that'll be a really exciting equation in formalism to lead up to and unpack the following section 4 is a question of quantum ontology this is going to touch on discussions that we've had including in live stream 40 on the free energy principle for generic Quantum systems and about what Quantum means and how we can think about things that are often described as being at the atomic scale whether it's the idea of quantum mechanics itself or bosons and fermions and all these other kind of like weight but I thought that was at the atom scale and what does it mean to apply it to cognitive systems there's then several cases that are addressed and those are the worked examples that's the matching of modes the tracking of modes with the subdivision into terminal mode matching and infinite mode tracking and then towards the end there's the adventuring into path tracking these are the three phases of Bayesian mechanics mode matching mode tracking and path tracking we're going to look into it and a simple case of G Theory and so that is where one gets to by the end of this journey but before we head off as promised we're going to dwell for a second on how we can set context to even head off on this journey so would anyone like to just describe like what the sections that we're about to jump into are about and what led us to use this approach uh oh yes uh actually as we discussed before um we will Begin by looking at some historical perspectives and historical contexts of all the developments of FAP literature throughout the past two decades and then we'll look at some of the key literature uh on which this particular paper relies upon and then we'll look at some the three kinds of theories uh that's been introduced in uh on Bayesian mechanics paper as uh the way of anchoring all the theoretical uh arguments there and uh finally we'll talk about uh the three non-bayesian mechanics before delving into what Bayesian mechanics uh is and what are the differences and similarities between uh all the different kinds of doing uh the physics or mechanics awesome this we hope sets the discussion within a historical and uh integrationist framing and it's going to be quite a journey so let's head into this section first let's talk about some historical perspectives and different epochs of research broadly we can think about what happened before the free energy principles emergence in the pre-2000 the pre-millennial era without going too specifically into the um what citation the free energy principle originates in then we can think about the free energy principle between roughly 2005 all the way up through 2020 around and then lastly some of the changes and developments in free energy principle literature since about 2019 to 20 and some of Dalton's contributions so starting with the free energy principle before 2000. there's no definitive history yet for the antecedents of the free energy principle and surely a presentation or project more focused on that history could and should and will happen but a few of the places to search for in terms of the personal history of key contributors and also places where uh peripheral contributions and important foundational precursors are described some places to look include the statistical parametric mapping textbook and documentation and the Decades of research that went into the neuroimaging work on SPM as well as a Carl friston 2012 article the history of the future of the Bayesian brain and an interview with Carl friston on wood lice and Men as well as the uh auxiliary supplement to the above interview am I autistic and intellectual autobiography so that'll take somebody from the sort of zero to eight and then 8 to 28 and then 28 and Beyond of Carl friston's work and development with copious references out on the right is a slide from live stream 14 where we explore just one aspect of tracing the thread which was from the analytical formalizations of for example Markov in terms of statistics and matrices all the way on through Pearl and the computational implementation of Bayesian statistics On Through To modern developments that integrate those kinds of Bayesian formulations of Statistics with action which encompasses a variety of fields such as cybernetics complex systems synergetics information Theory control theory ecological psychology for e-cognition extended embodied etc etc autonomous systems and all other types of Frameworks so it would be a history of the world to talk about everything that happened before 2000 but these are just some threats anything else that people want to add yeah maybe um that as the as the theory gets more integrated to various different fields I think it's going to be harder and harder to actually find that one thread that was the the development towards the free energy principle where the reality is probably that uh as with all roads leading to Rome many trajectories lead to the free energy principle nice Ollie uh and also related to this historical context I wanted to point out the uh the heated discussions that's going on uh during the last couple of years about the use of uh I mean some established vocabulary or terminology inactive inference or fep literature one of which is using the markup blanket in a kind of different context but as a Maxwell ramstead's uh Twitter Fred from yesterday as pointed out to a very interesting example we can say we can say the same for a lot of mathematical constructs for example we can look at the concept of zero as a purely mathematical construct but used in different contexts for example it can be used as a null as a null container or a null counter but on the other hand it can be seen as the solution of the polynomial or a function and the same goes here for using the the same mathematical construct or theoretical construct of Markov blanket but in a different context but that doesn't mean markup blankets or anytime any other theoretical Concepts used in FTP literature are denying the or somehow are contradictory with the previous uh usage of that terminology it's just used in uh different contexts awesome so as a really concise way to summarize again something where further presentations and work can do a much more comprehensive job there's a Maxwell ramstad tweet thread from 7-Eleven 2020. and Maxwell breaks down developments in the free energy principle modeling into several waves and the Tweet thread is readable here the first wave doesn't have policy selection per se the Dynamics of internal and active States was determined in a stepwise fashion through gradient descent on variational free energy and so that was very much like a pure one-step gradient descent framework second wave models started around 2012 equipped agents with beliefs about State Transitions and the sensory consequences of movement that allows the calculation of expected free energy like values and third wave models use a recursive expected free energy functional which opens up all of these uh related Avenues so Maxwell's thread here summarizes some of the waves of development and there's so much more to add and unpack because there's been developments on multiple different fronts or I wouldn't even know what word to say there has been formal developments and Technical elaborations as well as generalizations and also of course a huge area of philosophical discussion around these topics so um there's been a lot happening since 2005 to 2020 in free energy principle and this is going to get us up to where we're ready to explore what's happened in the last few years from this kind of building momentum and uh progress in the space anything to add Jacob um um maybe just a short comment that I think a lot uh a lot of the first and perhaps even the second wave uh we can probably see more influence of um Carl's Preston's prior work on SPM um and all the literature that uh surrounds it whereas in the kind of third age or third wave uh we are seeing more Integrations into other fields like um physics and oh welcome complexity science great Point as the literature builds and as other collaborators began to upskill and contribute then we start seeing some different approaches but there's initially a lot of similarities with SPM and it's really still quite a useful framework to use of course but also point back towards all right then on to the third epoch that's post 2020 and Dalton's contributions so we laughed and had a great time reviewing many of the fascinating developments over the last few years in a range of topics made by Dalton ranging from fundamental physics to neuroscience and most recently Bayesian mechanics and G Theory a lot of the work is single author other papers and works of note are collaborations for example with ramstead friston and others and this is just a few this is some subset screenshots from our coda knowledge integration work where we have a bunch of papers blog posts videos tweets we were just bringing together a lot of different information and we'll look forward to hearing it from The Source soon enough the specific papers that we want to discuss we're going to in the next session but this is all to say that it's been a quite productive streak for Dalton and an awesome learning experience for us all so we really appreciate all that work and we're looking forward to the conversations anything you want to add on this outside of the literature all right next we will go to the literature we're going to go through about four or five papers that are important steps on the way to getting to the worked example so let's just go right into it this is going to be a paper from outside of the friston sphere in in one sense but not in another sense it's a 2012 paper by Udo Seifert and the paper is called stochastic thermodynamics fluctuation theorems and molecular machines surely the paper is worth a deeper take but just to highlight at the very high level stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notion of classical thermodynamics such as work heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles that is going to be a key move and theme which is a move from a um kind of undifferentiated mass action or mean field approximation physics and finding compatibility between that kind of an averaging and recovering that averaging outcome via individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles one can imagine that if they're interested in the consideration of specific counterfactual policies or in the behavior of multi-agent ensembles Simply Having a mean field approximation the kind of which classical thermodynamics has provided for work key in entropy production it'll be another step and potentially an unprincipled or intractable one to ever go from that mean field down to the trajectory level and so the kind of synthesis work that has to occur and is pointed towards here is to understand how a special case or abridging formalism can connect this kind of mean field population scale summary statistic aggregate worlds two individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles anything else to add on this paper uh well actually I think uh one of its I mean the central importance of this paper to uh exactly vandeville's current paper is the the definition of uh the probability the past probability measure in the abstract wiener space uh mainly the equation number five which I believe is a very significant preliminary stage toward deriving the general equation of Bayesian mechanics or equation 15. excellent on to the next paper the next paper is a single author paper by Carl friston in 2019 a free energy principle for a particular physics so it's a little small on the slide but this is like an 148 page paper and you'll note there on the header this work is under consideration for publication by the MIT press so there's an interesting story who's middle and end is unknown about the recent active inference textbook and the way in which that is providing kind of a handbook of active inference but then there's something more like a theoretical physics book that is going to be presented in some future time particular physics is a multi entender or a pun in a few different ways this is a particular physics in the sense that because it's being specified it's like a specified or a specific physics like any dinner that you make is a particular dinner in that sense also really key to this notion of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles is the notion of the particle and the particular States the particular states are referring to when we have a partition that uses the Markov blanket so blanket States making internal and external States conditionally independent we can then talk about the blanket and the internal States as the particular States because they're like the particle that's floating around so in the Brownian mechanics world then you have the dust molecule floating around in the water and the particle is the dust molecule and then the external states are the water and along those lines the cognitive particle is going to be the internal and the blanket States that's what's going to have cognitive mass and inherit all of these physics terms that might be kind of like billiard balls are to classical mechanics we're going to be looking at what that particulate form is for cognitive systems this was an extremely important work conceptually as well as uh socially Maxwell ramstead facilitated and organized a really amazing Discussion Group over many months working with a lot of people to go through chapters and surfacing a lot of important thoughts that could be connected technical contributions raised by many participants in that reading group and um the work itself is a theory of everything but perhaps in a way that people might not expect so I'll just pause there if either of you want to give any overview thoughts on the monograph what does it mean by a theory of everything or what else would you add about this precursor paper in fact I wanted to point out uh an important note uh stated in the footnote number one of uh the classical physics paper and is T in this paper by Carl friston the word particle is used as you mentioned for the combination or the joint set of internal and blank States but in the current paper Dalton prefers to use the word system for that concept and where in for instance paper refers to system Dalton's paper uses um agent environmentally so that might be helpful for people who want to read that read the literature because in the rest of the literature it's basically the same thing the word particle is used as the joint set of the internal and blanket States but not in this one thank you Jacob want to add anything on the paper um maybe just do slightly uh add on The Theory of Everything uh that refers to the notion that anything that exists needs to have some kind of statistical independence from its environment um which is uh which constitutes a Markov blanket and I think we'll see in the in the coming slides that uh some contributions from Dalton have also shown this to be the case in uh in cases where the fep has previously been criticized uh for not actually applying generally to um to systems which uh don't reach that threshold um so yeah just wanted to uh add that nice when people talk about a theory of everything and they leave out the space they might mean like a theory of all of it but this is actually a theory of all of the open parentheses Observer dependent modeler dependent close parenthesis things that can be distinguished again that's where the Observer is in the distinguishing from other things in a statistical sense if you can't distinguish it over the time scale of observation it's just not a thing it's not to say that it's not part of someone else's theory of all of it but in this sense it's not a thing and that's what is also setting up at a very fundamental level for this notion of systems engaging in the bounding of surprise because systems that don't bound surprise will not be observed to be that kind of thing in the way that the surprise was limiting and the work also points importantly towards compatibility among Quantum statistical and classical mechanics those are the three non-bayesian mechanics that we're going to be going into Bayesian mechanics is going to generalize and Encompass and integrate across all of these and it may offer a formal description of lifelike particles for example classical mechanics could tell you what happens when a 200 pound object falls out of a plane but I think as Dean has raised what happens when that entity has a parachute so there's something different there and what could the reductionist physicist do other than try to make a physics model of the elbow and of the ions coming in and out of the neurons reductionism is kind of the way in that situation and so we're going to be talking about potentially a way to see that active particle falling out of the plane as something that could engage in agentic decisions next paper this next paper is the free energy principle made simpler but not too simple be careful um it is a paper from Carl friston DeCosta Sajid Heinz alzhoffer poliotis and Par we discussed this paper in several discussions earlier this year in live stream number 45. we have 45.0 background in context and we have the dot 1 and the dot two with uh Thomas Parr and Carl first and joining for the discussion and say many interesting and funny things the paper is providing a concise description of the free energy principle which begins from a Lang Van equation and ends with a Bayesian mechanics that can be read as a physics of sentience noting here that sentience refers to feeling and acting entities not to qualia phenomenology experiential entities per se although people have provided interpretations that go that way this paper rehearses key steps using standard results from statistical physics those steps are going to be one establish a particular partition of States based upon conditional independencies inheriting from sparse coupling again particular is being used in the pun since as it was before this is like one specific partition that you could choose to implement and it's the one that results in particles two unpacking the implications of that particular partition in terms of Bayesian inference one of the kinds of inference that's really important is about internal States doing inference on external States mediated through sense states on the blanket and then three describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action which is going to tie us towards understanding individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles um this paper was a discussed elsewhere so here's Brock and I in the dot zero talking about non-equilibrium birds and then here um we have blue and Carl and Thomas and we're just trying to catch up with what they're adding anything that you fellows would add about this paper all right now we're going to enter into the Dalton Zone so this is in April 2022. Dalton presents a single author paper towards a geometry and Analysis for Bayesian mechanics the paper presents a simple case of Bayesian mechanics under the free energy principle and formulates it axiomatically there's going to be a lot of interesting things to unpack um does anyone want to just give their read on the importance of this paper uh I think uh this is one of the first papers uh Dalton has attempted to provide the rigorous mathematical foundation for fep uh by providing uh some formal proofs of the relevant theorems but without uh I mean going into a lot of technical jargons I mean this paper is a pretty accessible uh for people even not specialized in mathematical proofs and so on but I mean by skipping those technical mathematical proofs the whole conceptual framework or the gist of the paper is totally accessible in my opinion so I think this is one of uh the very significant and important steps toward developing uh the more comprehensive Theory provided in the neck in their next paper on Bayesian mechanics great this is uh going to be connecting the random dynamical systems formalization and takes a further step towards comprehensive statement of the physics of self-organization in formal mathematical language which is presented using gauge Theory and some geometric Notions and that's going to create a concordance that can be at least stated qualitatively but has a lot of technical underpinnings which is the relationship between the dynamical systems notion of self-organization in terms of bounded surprise connecting that to a gauge theoretic formalism of self-organization in which gauge forces are acting on the system and others can and please should help us unpack this and do math streams with us and do a DOT three four five here we're going to point a little bit more briefly to two recent papers uh well they're all recent it's only September 2022. this was only five months ago here is a paper from uh August actually both of them are from August but the first one was first published in July the first paper is weak Markov blankets in high dimensional sparsely coupled random dynamical systems that's a paper by Dalton and then a paper with Maxwell Dalton and Carl on the map territory fallacy fallacy would either of you like to just pick one of them and just describe like what was cool or important about these papers I would uh maybe say on the weak Mark of blankets in high dimensional as partially a couple of random dynamical systems I think that paper is really crucial because it does unpack a lot of um a lot of uncertainty that many people might have uh had with the fep before uh especially the spark sparse coupling conjecture uh that finally received a formal formal proof um and I think it's also important in this paper that we are uh going to going to discuss especially when we are talking about systems at the quantum scale or beyond beyond the quantum scale where sparse coupling is more uh is a much more present notion than non-sparce coupling um yeah I think this is a key paper uh in all of these uh prerequisite papers thank you Ali feel free to say something you like about either or both uh adding to what Jacob said about weak marker Blanket's paper I think uh one other uh significant contribution of this paper to the fep literature is the introduction of the concept of blanket index which was a very I mean sorely needed concept uh because uh I mean by uh grading the markup blankets by by this concept uh we we can see that when we talk and talk about any markup blankets it's not a singular or I don't know necessarily uh 100 consistent concept but it can be graded um according to this blanket index namely that when the blanket index is zero we have the strongest markup blanket uh I mean that also recovers the sparse um coupled conjecture but when it maximizes we have this concept of me weak markup blankets which is uh basically what uh most linear systems has most linear systems have but when we discuss the higher dimensional systems or more complex systems uh the markup the blanket index uh somehow minimizes or in fact uh goes to zero in sparse coupled systems awesome Yes it is an important contribution and maybe we can unpack this paper more as they're also become more perhaps worked examples of weekly mixing Markov blanket the zones and anything to add on map territory fallacy fallacy go further and yeah this is also a kind of uh I believe a response to some of the criticisms going on about what's exactly the map and the territory of the fep I mean the free energy principle because most people believe that in fep maps and territories are conflated and that's a problematic a view in so many levels as discussed in this paper because uh the claim of the fep uh researchers are not that we uh have done some conflation of maps and territories in a uh kind of as setting on Bayesian mechanics paper a productive language abuse or notation abuse way but uh actually these are exactly uh Maps unto each other and we cannot separate them easily and talk about maps and territories so the the concept of map Theory fallacy fallacy comes from this Viewpoint uh by which this so-called fallacy is itself another level of awesome all right on to the next paper this is going to be a key recent paper from May 2022 it is on Bayesian mechanics a physics of and by beliefs of the beliefs by the beliefs for the beliefs with ramstead at all this is active guest stream number 23.1 so on the right here's uh Dalton Maxwell and Lars and I talking about uh what looks to be like it's going to be an American baseball field but actually it's a path of least action and this paper introduces or reintroduces a field of study that has emerged over the last decade called Bayesian mechanics and it's that reintroduction and uh like nice to meet you again for the first time which is why Maxwell called The Stream that we did rebooting the free energy principle literature the paper is extremely accessible and engagingly written it reviews the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle and then in this very nice figure that we're going to return to multiple times introduces the three faces of Bayesian mechanics we're going to go into them more in the worked example paper but they are fixed mode on the left Dynamic mode in the middle and then path tracking on the right side and the broader or the higher order like Genera or family level distinction is the fixed mode seeking and then that Dynamic mode tracking are regarding modes of densities Over States whereas path tracking moves us into a path native formalism rather than like a point in state space formalism and they're all faces of the Bayesian mechanics under the free energy principle and this paper not only discusses those three faces of Bayesian mechanics but it examines the duality of the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle developed and derived and explored in other Dalton work which we're not going to talk about here moving on that was the key literature now we're going to stick on this Bayesian mechanics paper and talk about three kinds of theories so the three kinds of theories that we're going to discuss are dynamics mechanics and principles and because Theory can take on many meanings it's important to quote the authors on how they use and therefore how we'll try to use the term so they wrote the word theory is polysimus it has many meanings what we have called Dynamics mechanics and principles are ultimately mathematical structures in mathematics these are called mathematical theories the content of a mathematical Theory or structure is purely formal what are usually called scientific theories or empirical theories comprise a mathematical structure and what might be called an empirical application interpretation or construal of that system which relates the constructs of the mathematical structure to things in the world so that is described and explored more in guest stream 23 and in this paper on Bayesian mechanics let's go first two Dynamics [Music] um go for it whoever would like to walk through these next three uh well yeah as indicated in amazing mechanics paper uh we can think about the Dynamics of a system as a kind of descriptive or phenomenological um let's say description of the system or uh the uh the kind of description that uh tries to answer the what questions of the system so if we look at it uh uh by the lens of many different uh physics or mechanics in classical physics we might uh characterize it as a kind of Galilean or pre-newtonian Dynamics or in a statistical physics we can say the behavioral particles under diffusion as an example of the Dynamics of the system in quantum physics we can talk about the quantum Dynamics as this kind of phenomenological description and actually we're talking the other day about this term Bayesian physics so we could have used in this slide on that sure how Dalton would react to that but in order not to duplicate the other slide which talks about Bayesian mechanics explicitly I've used that term here so yeah in Bayesian the physics we're dealing with with the system the systems by which the Dynamics uh of a self-organized self-organizing system or some authors would call Auto organizing systems awesome so Dynamics are describing the what and we're showing Bayesian physics again with the caveat Ali just mentioned alongside the three other physics that we're going to be discussing integration among so Dynamics are the what that's how the Billiards are moving on the table what is happening the next level is mechanics so somebody else may describe mechanics yes so the mechanics so moving from uh understanding what the systems uh that we want to describe are are the Mecha the mechanics uh can help us answer the how questions or actually create the mathematical formalism that will be able to make predictions about what is going to happen and how it happens So In classical physics we have classical mechanics either Newtonian lagrangian or hamiltonian uh in statistical physics we have statistical mechanics Quantum quantum mechanics describing how um how things behave on a Quantum scale which we're also going to unpack a bit further in the coming slides and then Bayesian mechanics with the mathematical formalism from the paper physics of beliefs and also the worked example um so the equations that come out of the mechanics are ones that can be used in a predictive sense uh all and also in further trying to understand um or in creating new systems that work on similar principles uh and I think mentioning principles might uh continue the good transition into into the into the third distinction the why questions uh which I can't are kind of these overarching the uh theorems or rather principles that say why things uh why the what and how questions or topics work the way they do um and principles usually form this kind of axiomatic uh or take this kind of axiomatic stance where uh from the principle everything else uh can be can be derived or can be put under the blanket off In classical physics the principle of stationary action is definitely one of the most fundamental that when when we have uh two points in space and we want a particle to to go from one point to another it will always follow a path of least action a path of least energy along that path uh the same uh the same thing uh is present in statistical physics and and quantum physics with quantum physics having the correspondence principle which is very relevant in uh in this paper uh where the this in the in the limit of of large of large numbers Quantum systems approximate to classical systems uh which I think speaks to uh is also related to the work here in the in the work example where um Quantum systems performing approximate Bayesian inference in a Quantum setting um follow classical paths on average which will get into into later and then Bayesian physics of course having the free energy principle awesome and just to put up what that table looks like we also had a ton of other correspondences and rows and columns so anyone who's interested in this kind of concordance building work would be encouraged to participate in the Institute because this is a really awesome tool and helps show us potentially areas where statistical mechanics has been applied as a mechanics can we bring Bayesian mechanics to bear or areas where stationary action was applied for classical systems can we talk about how the free energy principle might be able to reformulate that or provide access to new tools or New Perspectives so this was our uh part of our table let's go a little bit deeper into those three non-bayesian mechanics or the three non-bayesian physics again I'm really looking forward to exploring different ways that we can think and talk about these different physics mechanics but just one kind of way to think about how the special case of one physics could be an entire other physics like Jakob just described like in the so-called classical limit Quantum systems behave classically but then also it has a space that goes beyond classical but that doesn't negate the relevance or utility or Simplicity of classical mechanics so how can something be encompassing but also provide identity for the special case and it reminded me of the anatomy of a mammalian muscle fiber with this kind of hierarchical organization of blankets it even looks so much like the blanket illustrations that we've seen and so we can think about um classical as then being a limit case of statistical and statistical being a limit case of quantum and then that is where Bayesian mechanics is going to come into play okay first classical mechanics who would like to do their uh short one slider presentation yes Jacob um so classical mechanics uh as the name implies uh describes the behavior of classical objects um and I think the kind of two main threats to highlight here that are relevant even for understanding the paper uh on the worked example of Bayesian mechanics is the Newtonian mechanics which uh is usually the the classical mechanics that's uh the first that people hear about with the with forces describing how um uh with the description of the movements of objects described how based on how forces are acting upon them and the three fundamental laws and then the lagrangio mechanics which take this more energy slash uh principle of least action um stance where the main the main um thing of interest is the lagrangian which is just the kinetic energy minus the potential energy of the system and it takes a kind of higher level view of how uh of given given um kind of generalized coordinates of motion how do systems evolve through time and then of course we could talk about hamiltonian mechanics which is just a transformation of lagrangian mechanics uh but those are the two I think main threats to understand and we also have the principle of uh least stationary action uh that is described that can be visualized with uh the picture in the top right corner um with the brickistochrone uh where you have two points and multiple paths can be connected to that point but only one path is the one of least action and in this case that would be the red path where if you drop the ball on on that on that surface uh the ball following the red curve would take the least amount of time to travel between those two points why is everyone in a hurry okay on to statistical mechanics well here Ali do you want to go for it uh well yes uh the statistical mechanics actually deals with theories producing the behavior of systems with probabilistic degrees of freedom especially the Ensemble level behavior of large numbers of functionally identical things at least according to on Bayesian mechanics paper but I wanted to point out a comment made in one of Dalton's posts about uh the state the status of statistical mechanics in relation to all the other areas of physics he writes beginning from uh Einstein theoretical physicists were interested in formulating all these physical theories in terms of purely mathematical and rigorous formalisms and so we have a rigorous theory of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics and so on but one conspicuous absence in this list is the statistical mechanics here because or thermodynamics because although we have some physicists in the 20th century physicist mathematicians like James and Carl McGrath and so on but up to now statistical physics uh remains mystery uh not not that all the related areas of physics for example the thermodynamical systems condensed matter and soft matter or biological systems they remains complete Mysteries so uh one of Dalton's AIMS in producing these literature throughout the past several months uh is at least to the best of my understanding is to somehow uh cover up this yawning Gap in the literature and doing that via formulating uh this Bayesian mechanics which can Encompass uh purely mathematical formalism of statistical mechanics as well and uh also one of the most fundamental principles of the statistical physics uh which Dalton has used in these papers in order to formulate Bayesian mechanics is James's maximum entropy principle which is a principle uh by which the mechanics of statistical objects lead to diffusion or the descriptive dynamics of the systems great thank you and from this paper by about in 2012 we can start to bridge Quantum and statistical mechanics by looking at how on different criteria they have some concordances so this is like going one layer deeper into those concordances let's go on to Quantum okay so quantum we've discussed Quantum a few times on these live streams we've discussed some relevant topics in live stream 17 with Chris fields and then more recently in live stream number 40 with Fields glaze book glazebrook friston and Levin and would either of you like to describe Quantum in terms of where it originated from and how we might be looking at it a little bit differently here than some have seen yeah I uh I think as uh physics develop over time and we were trying to describe uh smaller and smaller systems that higher precisions um at some point we realize that systems don't obey these uh classical laws set forth by by Newton or or LaGrange or others and quantum mechanics is the formalism for describing systems on a subatomic scale uh I think the one of the two major Concepts um to mention is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle uh which states that when you have a subatomic particle you there's always an uncertainty on its position in physical space and its velocity where there's actually this kind of uh entanglement of the two in the sense that if you know one with certainty you know the other with uncertainty and vice versa and you have this kind of um and you can move along this line where uh where you can partially know the position or partially know the velocity but not both at the same time which I think is really interesting from the point of Bayesian mechanics because quantum mechanics is really the one of the first um subfields of science where the notion of an observer and the the act of observation has needed to be ingrained in the actual mathematical Theory uh because you can't just shine a light on an electron because that will ultimately change the system uh and so the interaction of the Observer and and the environment and Performing inference over uh what what does uh what do individual how do individual things in the environment behave uh I think that's something that Bayesian mechanics is trying to it's trying to unify and I think the quantum ontology is very relevant in this case and of course we um have um there are quantum mechanics is obviously a large field that's also um connected to various other fields one other uh notion to mention would be the double slit experiment that's depicted in the in the image on the on the right which in it which was one of the first uh if not the first I'm actually not sure at the moment uh instances showing the wave particle duality of subatomic particles in this case electrons where uh you just where particles display behaviors of both waves and and particles and the behavior is very dependent on the way that we do our observations if we want to observe the electrons passing through a slit before they reach uh the screen that influences the behavior the behavior of the electrons then uh when we look at the screen after all of the electrons have passed through the slits um so we have these kind of weak Markov blankets but without the actual introduction before the introduction of weak Markov blankets awesome it's kind of like all the jokes around how people behaving differently when you're observing them now there's a cognitive analog so some of those intuitions weren't so far off after all and we won't talk about the paper too much but there's a recent paper from September 2022 connecting the free energy principle with Quantum cognition where they introduce this concept of excess Bayesian inference which is kind of like Bayesian inference in a Quantum lattice it's quite an interesting idea and it speaks to this intersection of quantum cognitive theories not in the sense per se that they've been developed in the orc or Quantum microtubule entanglement of electrons domain which is still like a physical material properties topic thinking about how atomic scale phenomena have Rippling effects at the entities level the organism's level whereas these applications of quantum cognition to larger cognitive systems may be absolutely compatible with those kind of orcor or Quantum microtubule theories but they do not require that to happen it is more going to be referring to their ability to engage in counter factual spaces and the relationality that Jacob mentioned all that brings us to Bayesian mechanics okay who wants to go for basic mechanics well yeah and Beijing in mechanics we're dealing with coupled systems that perform inference over the systems to which they coupled in other words uh we're dealing with particular partitions in this sense of response 2019 paper or the other uh the rest of the literature and uh or the we're looking at the systems that minimize their own surprisal when the systems minimize their own surprisal they must somehow know something about their environment I mean inferring something about the external state is the classical view of the fep at least as it initially formulated but this surprisal minimization follows from a kind of synchronization between the the internal and external States via synchronous synchrony map or Sigma which is simply the statement the things which exist reflect the data about their environments which is their way of saying the above statement as well and also things that are surprising or things that ought not happen as we expect like breaking the laws of physics in other words it might look as a kind of tautology for a system that would not we will not expect for a system to behave in a way in a very surprising way in other words behave in a way that obey obey the laws of physics but one of the main points of the Bayesian mechanics is to formulate this exact Viewpoint by not focusing on a single trajectory of a behavior but by somehow generalizing that statement to a whole fiber bundles of behavior as they say in the gauge Theory so uh and uh systems in this sense can somehow be duly described uh instead of the traditional view of the fep uh they can be described from the other way around by using the constraints maximum entropy principle I mean instead of looking at the system or agent from the inside and trying to trying to somehow formulate uh its inference of the of its external Behavior external State we can put the observer in the external environment looking at the system and deriving the exact same formula formulation by just flipping around or inverting the sigma synchrony map so that's one of the I believe Central ideas uh of sorry Central ideas of Bayesian mechanics Jacob I would uh just kind of summarize that by pointing attention to uh the image in on the slide um already caption I'll read the caption and you can provide an image meme analysis the left side says when the tree blows and shakes a tree branch it is because the tree branch has inertia but not enough to resist the force of a wind on another Dot and then on the right side it says when the wind blows and shakes a tree branch it is because the tree branch reduces its surprisal about the state of the World by modeling it yes so these are essentially equivalent statements one from the classical perspective another from the Bayesian mechanical perspective uh I think this notion might initially sound counter-intuitive uh which is why I think it's good to um start talking about it now so that it uh has time to to settle by by the time we reach G Theory um I think that pretty much summarizes it yes it's pan inferentialist without being pan psychist per se Ali also pointed to that extremely important theoretical duel between the free energy principle and constrained maximum entropy principle which then was mapped onto this View From the Inside which is kind of a strategic agent trying to synchronize with external States or learn or reduce their surprise about external States as mediated by the blanket States that's the view from the inside and the view from the outside which brings us to the relationality Jacob raised in the quantum space the view from the outside is as an experimenter and the fact that Dalton has shown that these two Frameworks are dual to each other is provided some of the most important theoretical synthesis in the area now the three phases of Bayesian mechanics so I'll uh bring larger a slide that was shared at iy recently the 2022 conference and it shows the three faces of Bayesian mechanics mode matching mode tracking path tracking those are the three phases that also are reflected in the earlier paper and that was guest stream 23.1 in addition here we see on the right is this chaos and that is kind of um a little bit beyond where we're going to go today but it's an exciting Direction so does anyone want to describe the three faces and then we'll head into the topics and paper um do you think um maybe because we uh have like detailed um size for each of the yeah just to say that these are three different faces of basic mechanics and we'll talk more about them soon okay here are some topics we're not going to talk about them at all at all but we left some open slides and space to add even more because they're topics that we want to talk with Dalton and you all about so supersymmetry this was the citation in the paper free energy principle and constrained maximum entropy Principle as theoretical duels Bayesian fermions bosons and ghost fields and anything else that people bring up we made it to the paper let's review the road map before we really head off on this journey and to make this a reasonable dot zero and not go out too far beyond what we all understand here we're just going to be really looking at a few uh key points and if either of you want to highlight something please just raise your hand and highlight it on that slide otherwise we're just going to take a brief stroll through the paper so again just raise your hand on the slide if you want to say something the paper begins with a formalization um or a a scoping of the formalizations that will come in terms of Bayesian mechanics and about how it's going to connect to derivations of classical physics constrained maximum entropy or constrained maximum caliber as well as supersymmetry theory in classical mechanics section 2 classical physics in one dimension is studying the mechanics of classical objects and the way in which that they embody Newton's Law which is that systems accelerate along Force gradients think back to jakob's distinction between Newtonian mechanics as forces acting on objects versus the lagrangian formalization precisely in the direction and magnitude of the total Force applied no more and no less section 2A continues Along on this direction and talks about different ways that mechanics can be specified around Motion in gravitational fields like moving objects and also approximations arising from fluid flow section 2B is the basics of Bayesian mechanics Bayesian mechanics can be seen as an account of the laws of motion deriving from the fep concerning how Bayesian beliefs that is systems with beliefs such as coupled random dynamical systems which perform inference over the things to which they couple behave under certain determinants of probabilistic motion and this is another really interesting note much like classical mechanics serves as an account of systems that obey Newton's second law by minimizing classical action Bayesian mechanics is an account of systems that engage in approximate Bayesian inference by minimizing surprisal so the ball minimizes energy by Falling the candle minimizes Gibbs free energy by burning cognitive systems are minimizing free energy by way of minimizing surprisal otherwise they would fail to be that thing 2B continues on to to be or not to be the pure physics of the fep arguably dates back to two Landmark papers in the literature a free energy principle for particular physics first in 2019 and Mark out blankets information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics which we didn't review here the fep has gestured at a new sort of physics and that is what this work is recently bringing a quite exciting Crescendo and examples of and here is a referral to the Dual nature of fep and constrained maximum entropy continuing on in section 2B we see a little bit of an unpacking around the idea that the fep is a least action principle a pride to surprisal where the application of least surprisal principle to specific objects determines mathematical or determines the mechanical theory about these objects so would be awesome for those who are familiar with Edo calculus and stochastic differential equations lagrangian mechanics and path probability measures here we get to equation 15 Ali if you want to unpack a little bit What's Happening Here is actually equation 15 is the kind of generalization of equation five for a modal path given by the equation 12 and this equation is described as the general equation for Bayesian classical mechanics or we can see that as the most Central equation by which all the other results or their derivations can potentially be derived I guess so here Q represents the position but as a slight caveat here uh because in most other literature Q is used for uh the uh for designating the recognition density but in this paper recognition density is designated with r so the Q is reserved for position and obviously T is also the time uh the lambdas here represents the the LaGrange multipliers uh and we have uh kind of limiting uh a limiting situation or limiting condition in which uh the inverse of Lambda is much lower than one and the Lambda 2 is equals to one yes that's exactly the points there and in this limiting situation we can reproduce the classical Dynamics in particular in the limit Lambda 1 uh it goes to Infinity there is no uncertainty at all and the most likely path under those constraints the classical path of least action by construction is the only path we land any non-zero probability to so all the other uh classical and even Quantum derivations can potentially be uh again be derived from this Central equation here great we have all the equations prepared to explore further now we're going to go into those three faces of Bayesian mechanics so let's just start with mode matching Jacob do you want to describe mode matching yeah so mode matching uh is the simplest case of Bayesian Mechanics for stationary objects um the interesting thing that uh Delta mentioned in the paper is that mode matching is only really valid for brief time scales implying that nothing ever really stays stationary uh I would be interested to uh unpack this further in the dot one and the dot two how brief these time scales can uh can actually be is it just instantaneous is anything ever stationary and how are different reference frames involved but in the simplest case uh we can uh mode matching considers objects that at least uh in the approximate sense are stationary like a ball uh resting on the ground where the ball is essentially doing approximate Bayesian inference on the on its gravitational pull and on the normal force that is uh acting to resist that gravitational pull and in the Bayesian mechanical sense if it wouldn't do that that would be surprising and therefore it wouldn't be a ball because it would fail to act within the confines of the environment and therefore in mode matching um Bayesian mechanics does reduce to or rather imply Newton's first law where for every uh for every applied force there is a force of equal magnitude applied in the opposite direction or for every action there's a reaction great like why don't you ever change your mind I'm mode matching what are you talking about I'm doing optimal Bayesian inference I've been doing it all day okay mode tracking so in mode tracking we're going to now generalize from that ball resting on the ground to what setting Ali or Jacob uh well yeah in the mode tracking unlike the case of mood matching we have uh the target mode or the desired mode um toward which the systems um are tracking so that's uh I believe the the main difference between the mode matching and the mill tracking approaches uh so uh but uh within the mode tracking we also have two subtypes of mode tracking one of which is the terminal mode matching and the other one is the infinite mode tracking so in the case of terminal mode matching we already have the terminal modes toward which the system and actually somehow uh the probabilistic states the probabilistic space of the system uh tracks its trajectory but in the case of infinite mode tracking uh we don't have a I mean some end points because it's a kind of uh analogous to a circular satellite motion uh by which we don't have the beginning and the end of the trajectory so uh also this kind of mode tracking uh has been described as a as an alternative term a mode chasing uh so I believe uh we can elaborate and unpack the details of that with tolton great Jacob I will just add to the infinite modes tracking case one very interesting um um thing that Dalton mentioned in the paper is that when you have this when you have a constant path That's essential uh that you're performing the infinite mode tracking on the the state uh of the the surprisal of your states are always non-zero which I find really interesting because uh for me it kind of implies that there's always a certain level of uncertainty but at the same time this contrasts with the infinite case where for for the case of planets orbiting orbiting the Sun um the there's there shouldn't be that much uncertainty about about the path because you know you're going to follow that path uh for uh till the end of time uh just one thing that I found interesting awesome so again just to recap for those who are looking for those worked examples in the mode matching case we have a ball on the ground the mass is not moving we then have a situation where the equilibrium steady state so to say is not where the mass is now the center of gravity is in motion in the mode matching case the center of gravity is not in motion the two cases of mode tracking where the center of gravity needs to be moving cognitive center of gravity is terminal mode matching which is equivalent to a ball thrown in a parabola where there are some defined endpoints but it's moving along a path of least action towards that endpoint and infinite mode tracking where it's in a continuous dynamical or oscillatory acceleration process and again it's super interesting to think about what these actually entail cognitively I'm sure we'll get there on to section seven so section seven broadens the discussion from the state tracking uh framework of modes remembering this image where all of the modes whether fixed mode or dynamic mode are regarding densities Over States now we have densities over paths enabled by the gauge theoretic formalisms so here are some equations and quotes related to path tracking anything to add foreign yes go ahead go ahead yeah sorry I was just explicitly mention uh one point on the slide that the formulation that path tracking is essentially the formulation of mode tracking seen as a gradient Ascent on the path probability density I think that um is um an important notion uh in under in understanding what the difference between path tracking and most tracking is um and also uh maybe uh as a slight mathematical joke uh the usage of of the word reduces to when moving in between equations that employ the path tracking uh formalism uh can also be a bit uncertain on the on the first on the first read Holly okay yes I also wanted to mention that active inference is kind of uh subsumed in this type of path tracking systems so and also the initial formulations of fep up to 2019 uh I mean especially the 2019 car for instance uh monograph implicitly deals with this path tracking approach as far as I know but somehow this typology of different kind of Bayesian mechanics is a pretty new to these uh recent literature and uh before that uh there was a lot of there were a lot of confusions and misunderstanding about what kind of systems are we dealing with uh in each paper awesome then at the very end there's a first idea of G Theory so just like variational free energy has F equation 2.5 from the textbook and expected free energy is G equation 2.6 in the textbook here we move from F free energy principle Tristan to G Beyond and we'll talk more about this with Dalton but if anybody wants to add anything they're welcome to I think uh one uh one thread that was open towards the end of the paper was with the application of G Theory to uh to uh chaos with the notion that we can use Bayesian mechanics to stud to study systems that uh that uh seem that are dependent on the initial the initial conditions and even though this uh this was so far purely described in the context of non-biological entities I think it's really exciting to see the potential applications in applied active inference where the your initial belief states do influence your trajectory through uh through the through the uh the high dimensional State space and I think it will be very interesting to see how G Theory develops in that way and to see more connections between how we can use um Notions from supersymmetry and chaos to studying cognitive systems or physical systems cognitively uh yeah awesome very well said like there are phase transitions or critical moments where when the ball falls on one side of the roof it goes that way and when it falls on the other side of the roof it goes a different way and there are just noticeable differences in terms of our psychophysics and this is really bringing the physics to psychophysics and it's been quite a journey if either of you have any penultimate thoughts please provide them well as I said before um it's been an extremely fascinating learning experience for me personally and I'm very much looking forward to discuss all of these uh stunning ideas with Dalton and learn much more so thanks to everyone thank you Ali Jacob yeah I think I made my own over uh um my kind of ending remark uh with the with the last uh comment but yeah it's been it's been an incredible journey so far and definitely and an extremely fun experience to try to unpack this and uh in in our discussions and I look forward to unpacking even more and uh seeing how how uh This Thread develops yes thanks both and Andre for all the work leading up to it and until next time thanks bye
