# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion revolves around active inference, generative models, and the relationship between policies, affordances, and cognition.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The cohort discussed Chapter One and its key concepts related to active inference.
2. Roger Shank's passing and his contributions to learning through doing were acknowledged.
3. The generative process involves passing observations to the model, influencing perception and action.
4. Policies can be seen as sequences of affordances, impacting decision-making over time.
5. The distinction between epistemic and pragmatic affordances was explored in relation to actions.
6. Exploration and exploitation are balanced through expected free energy calculations.
7. Direct and inferential perception were debated regarding their implications for cognition.
8. The cohort discussed the relevance of Bayesian inference in cognitive modeling and perception.
9. Future chapters will delve deeper into the low and high roads of active inference.
10. The importance of addressing questions and clarifications in discussions was emphasized for understanding.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference connects perception and action within cognitive models.
2. Policies are sequences of actions influenced by preferences and observations.
3. Exploration and exploitation are crucial in navigating decision-making processes.
4. Understanding the generative process is key to modeling cognition and behavior.
5. Future discussions will focus on more technical aspects of active inference.
