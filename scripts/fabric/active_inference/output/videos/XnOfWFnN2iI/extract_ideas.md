- The live stream discusses active inference and its application to understanding consciousness.
- Teamc aims to improve online communication and learning related to active inference.
- Upcoming discussions will focus on projective consciousness and phenomenal selfhood.
- Active inference may integrate fields like geometry, cybernetics, and neurophenomenology to explain consciousness.
- Keywords discussed include cybernetics, projective geometry, consciousness, and neurophenomenology.
- Cybernetics examines control and communication in goal-oriented systems across various orders.
- Different orders of cybernetics include self-regulation influenced by observers and ecological contexts.
- Historical context reveals fluctuating attitudes towards cybernetics in the Soviet Union.
- Projective geometry relates to the perception and planning of actions in consciousness.
- Consciousness is divided into biofunctional, cognitive neurofunctional, and information theoretic theories.
- The projective consciousness model aims to integrate insights from existing theories of consciousness.
- The model emphasizes the role of geometry in understanding consciousness's appearance and functioning.

- Experimental approaches to consciousness face ethical and methodological challenges.
- Different frameworks for consciousness produce divergent conclusions about animal consciousness.
- The concept of forward and reverse tests for consciousness is introduced in the study.
- The paper emphasizes the need for calibrated instruments in consciousness research.
- Five functional features of consciousness include global optimization, global availability, motivation of action, simulation enhancement, and modulation of attention.
- Five phenomenological invariants characterize consciousness: relational phenomenal intentionality, situated spatiality, multimodal integration, temporal integration, and subjective character.
- The projective consciousness model aims to unify various aspects of consciousness research.
- The relationship between consciousness and the free energy principle is explored in the context of action and perception.
- The paper discusses the implications of consciousness frameworks on social and legal systems.
- Active inference research aims to deepen understanding of consciousness and its implications for behavior.
