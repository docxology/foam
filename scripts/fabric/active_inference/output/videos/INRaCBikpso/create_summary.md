# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Lab symposium discusses active inference principles, applications, educational frameworks, and collaborative research strategies.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Lab focuses on developing applications of the active inference framework.
2. Three organizational units: edu, coms, and tools facilitate symposium sessions.
3. Accessibility in research frameworks is crucial to avoid research debt.
4. Collective intelligence is necessary for transdisciplinary teams and projects.
5. Educational materials aim to create a dynamic knowledge base on active inference.
6. The ontology development underpins the educational body of knowledge.
7. Core ideas for active inference include generative models and free energy principles.
8. Active inference emphasizes active perception and belief updating processes.
9. Free energy principle relates to self-organizing systems and their dynamics.
10. Distinguishing between subject matter and prediction matter experts enhances understanding of active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference aims to simplify the learning and application of complex frameworks.
2. Transdisciplinary collaboration enriches research and educational efforts in active inference.
3. Developing a coherent ontology is essential for effective communication and understanding.
4. Active perception plays a pivotal role in the process of active inference.
5. Understanding the relationship between free energy and active inference aids in grasping their applications.
