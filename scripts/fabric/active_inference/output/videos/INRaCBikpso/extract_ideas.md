IDEAS

- The Active Inference Lab is a non-profit organization focused on the active inference framework.
- The symposium includes various sessions facilitated by organizational units: edu, coms, and tools.
- Applying active inference across systems is a central theme of the symposium discussions.
- Research debt refers to the burden of developing research frameworks that are hard to apply.
- Increasing accessibility in early framework formalization helps avoid future complications.
- Collective intelligence manifests across transdisciplinary teams and projects, vital for modern research.
- The edu unit aims to create a participatory active inference knowledge base.
- The terms list v1 was released and is being updated to version 2 with translations.
- Ontology and formalized ontologies are essential for developing educational materials on active inference.
- Knowledge engineering is being used to create educational materials and textbooks for active inference.
- Toy simulations can help demystify active inference and illustrate its functionality.
- A generative model is critical for understanding and applying active inference effectively.
- The core ideas of active inference should be communicated clearly for effective education.
- Active inference describes a process arising from the free energy principle, impacting various fields.
- Active inference goes beyond predictive processing, emphasizing active engagement with the environment.
- The relationship between active inference and the free energy principle involves applying the latter to specific systems.
- Information plays a dual role in the free energy principle, underpinning derivations and beliefs about external states.
- Markov blankets separate agent states from external states, facilitating belief updating in active inference.
- The integrity of active inference is maintained by linking dynamics with statistical independences and causal frameworks.
- Subject matter experts concentrate on specific fields, while prediction matter experts think distributively across domains.
- Active inference allows for modeling responses to environments, leading to distinctions between subject and prediction expertise.
