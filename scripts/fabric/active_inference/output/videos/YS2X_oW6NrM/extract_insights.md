- Active inference allows for understanding how our brains predict reality through sensory inputs and experiences.

- Immersive technology can reshape our movement skills by altering our bodyâ€™s prediction errors in real-time.

- Psychedelics may enhance creativity by breaking down rigid cognitive frameworks, allowing for new perceptual possibilities.

- Multimodal experiences can improve learning by integrating various sensory inputs and minimizing prediction errors.

- Playful, non-goal-oriented activities can enhance motor learning by reducing cognitive load and enhancing flow states.

- Joint actions in improvisational contexts promote synchronization and empathy among individuals, enhancing group dynamics.

- Technology should provide accurate feedback to enhance learning and movement, avoiding misleading sensory inputs.

- Higher prediction errors during psychedelics can facilitate model updating, particularly in therapeutic contexts for trauma.

- Encouraging physical movement during remote work can counteract the negative effects of sedentary behavior on mental health.

- Bridging the gap between movers and technology can lead to innovative applications that enhance human experience and well-being.

- The balance of hierarchical structures in teams should prioritize physical connection to improve collaboration and trust.

- Understanding the body as a dynamic system is essential for improving mental and physical health outcomes.

- Engaging in playful, exploratory movement can foster creativity and resilience in both personal and professional contexts.

- Technological interventions should enhance, rather than constrain, our natural abilities and intuitive understanding of movement.

- Developing tools that promote joint physical actions can enhance social connection in remote work environments.
