# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Sarah Haskins discusses active inference, VR, and psychedelics, exploring their impact on movement learning and cognitive processes.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference involves minimizing prediction errors through sensory input and motor actions.
2. Sarah Haskins has a background in cognitive neuroscience and VR technology.
3. VR can enhance the brain's motor learning capabilities through multimodal sensory integration.
4. The study examined bimanual interference tasks to understand movement learning in VR.
5. Visual feedback can dominate proprioceptive input, affecting motor performance negatively.
6. Higher prediction errors can lead to enhanced learning and adaptation in motor tasks.
7. Psychedelics can disrupt top-down predictions, allowing for new cognitive insights and learning.
8. Joint actions and improvisation enhance synchronization and connection in group dynamics.
9. Movement and physical interaction are crucial for cognitive development and emotional well-being.
10. Bridging technology and movement practices can foster better learning environments and team dynamics.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference plays a vital role in how we learn motor skills and adapt to new environments.
2. Visual perception often overrides proprioceptive feedback, impacting performance and learning.
3. Psychedelics can facilitate profound cognitive shifts by increasing prediction errors.
4. Engaging in physical movement enhances group dynamics and fosters empathy in collaborative settings.
5. Integrating technology with physical practices can create more effective learning and rehabilitation experiences.
