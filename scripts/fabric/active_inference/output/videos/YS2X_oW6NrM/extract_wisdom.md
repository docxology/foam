# SUMMARY
Sarah Haskins discusses the intersection of active inference, VR, and psychedelics, exploring their implications for learning, movement, and mental health.

# IDEAS:
- Active inference integrates sensory input and predictions to minimize prediction error in our brains.
- VR can enhance motor skills through immersive experiences and embodied feedback mechanisms.
- Visual feedback in VR can sometimes overshadow proprioceptive feedback, leading to performance decline.
- Higher prediction error can promote neural plasticity and model updating in the brain.
- Classical psychedelics alter brain predictions, creating new realities and reducing rigid thought patterns.
- Joint actions in improvisational contexts foster empathy and synchronization among individuals.
- Movement is essential for cognitive functioning, influencing our mental states and health.
- Lowering prediction error can help alleviate mental health issues by creating new neural pathways.
- Multimodal integration in VR enhances the sense of self and movement accuracy.
- The brain's reliance on visual information often compromises proprioceptive accuracy during learning.
- Embodied technology can help bridge the gap between physical and digital interactions.
- High-level goals in movement training can inhibit natural learning processes.
- VR can offer opportunities for rehabilitation by creating embodied experiences that reshape body awareness.
- Active inference principles can inform approaches to mental health and trauma recovery.
- Accurate sensory feedback is crucial for effective learning and skill acquisition in both VR and real life.
- The body's movement patterns can significantly affect cognitive processes and emotional states.

# INSIGHTS:
- Active inference highlights the brain's dynamic nature in processing sensory information and predictions.
- VR's immersive qualities can reshape our understanding of body awareness and skill learning.
- Prediction error management is crucial for learning and adapting to new environments or experiences.
- Psychedelics can facilitate profound shifts in perception and cognition, aiding mental health therapies.
- Movement, when liberated from rigid goals, can enhance creativity and cognitive flexibility.
- Interpersonal synchronization enhances communication and connection in team dynamics.
- The balance of sensory input is vital for optimal performance in skill-based tasks.
- Higher levels of prediction error can serve as catalysts for personal growth and healing.
- Visual dominance in sensory processing emphasizes the need for integrated feedback mechanisms.
