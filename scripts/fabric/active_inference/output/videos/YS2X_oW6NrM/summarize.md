# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Sarah Haskis discusses active inference, VR, and psychedelics, exploring their impact on movement, perception, and cognitive processes.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Sarah Haskis introduces her research on VR and psychedelics in the context of active inference.
2. Active inference refers to minimizing prediction error in cognitive processes through sensory input.
3. VR can enhance motor skills by integrating visual and proprioceptive feedback.
4. The follow-me exercise demonstrates active inference through movement prediction and correction.
5. Bimanual interference tasks reveal how visual modality can dominate proprioceptive feedback.
6. High prediction error can lead to better learning outcomes in movement tasks.
7. Psychedelics can weaken top-down priors, allowing for new and varied cognitive predictions.
8. Movement and physical engagement are crucial for improving cognitive and emotional health.
9. Joint actions and improvisation foster empathy and synchronization within teams.
10. Emphasizing low-level physiological feedback can enhance learning and collaboration in remote work.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Incorporate physical movement into remote work to enhance cognitive function and team dynamics.
2. Use VR technology to create immersive learning experiences that leverage active inference.
3. Explore psychedelics as tools for updating cognitive models in therapeutic settings.
4. Foster a collaborative environment by prioritizing joint actions and shared experiences.
5. Understand the importance of balancing top-down and bottom-up processing in learning and development.
