# IDEAS

- Active inference is a framework that connects perception, action, and learning through prediction.
- Sarah Haskis has researched VR's effects on brain-body connections and active inference in motor skills.
- Immersive technology can empower the psychedelic ecosystem through embodied tech.
- Active inference can minimize prediction error using sensory inputs and motor actions.
- Visual cues can enhance learning motor skills by reducing prediction error in children.
- Proprioception and visual perception integration influences motor learning and prediction error.
- VR can modify sensory input to influence brain predictions and motor control.
- Bimanual interference highlights challenges in executing different movements with each hand.
- Feedback loops in VR can either aid or hinder motor skill acquisition.
- Prediction error can be modulated by visual and proprioceptive feedback during tasks.
- Higher-level goals in motor tasks can lead to increased prediction errors and performance issues.
- Psychedelics can decompose brain predictions, allowing for new perceptions and experiences.
- Classical psychedelics activate 5-HT2A receptors, altering neural prediction dynamics.
- Increased prediction error during psychedelic experiences can lead to model updating and healing.
- Movement and physical activity are essential for cognitive function and mental health.
- Joint actions in team dynamics can enhance collaboration and empathy among members.
- Encouraging movement during remote work can counteract the mental health crisis caused by sedentary lifestyles.
- Gamifying movement and incorporating physical tasks can enhance engagement and learning in remote teams.
- Bridging technology and movement can foster deeper connections and understanding in collaborative environments.
- Understanding the role of lower-level physiological states is critical for improving team dynamics and performance.
