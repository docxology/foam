# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Mark Solms discusses the foundational role of affect in consciousness, challenging traditional views centered on cortical processes.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Affect is claimed to be the foundational form of consciousness and is intrinsically conscious.
2. Feelings cannot exist without being felt, making them unique in consciousness.
3. Consciousness depends on brainstem structures, not just cortical processes.
4. The hard problem of consciousness is misframed by focusing on perception rather than affect.
5. Affects are generated in the brainstem and can exist without cortical involvement.
6. Many internal bodily sensations are perceived without affective qualities.
7. Emotional responses can arise from external stimuli, challenging the idea of affect as purely internal.
8. The distinction between affect and perception is crucial for understanding consciousness.
9. Consciousness can occur in the absence of cortex, as shown in certain patient cases.
10. There is a need for a shift in neuroscience to recognize affect's role in consciousness.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Feelings are essential to consciousness and cannot be unconscious.
2. The brainstem plays a critical role in generating affects and consciousness.
3. Traditional views of consciousness focusing on the cortex may be misguided.
4. Affects can arise from both internal and external stimuli.
5. Understanding consciousness requires an integrated view of affect and its mechanisms.
