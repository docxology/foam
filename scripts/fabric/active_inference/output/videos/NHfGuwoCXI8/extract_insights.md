- Affect is the foundational form of consciousness, intrinsically tied to the experience of feelings.  
- Feelings cannot exist without being felt; thus, they serve as the essence of consciousness.  
- Consciousness arises from brainstem activity, challenging the cortical-centric view of cognitive neuroscience.  
- Emotional responses can occur without cortical involvement, revealing a deeper layer of consciousness.  
- Affective states are not synonymous with interoceptive inference; they encompass broader emotional experiences.  
- The hard problem of consciousness may be reframed by focusing on the nature of feelings.  
- Feelings provide a direct experiential quality that is absent in mere cognitive functions or perceptions.  
- Consciousness can exist in individuals with significant cortical damage, emphasizing the role of subcortical structures.  
- Predictions in consciousness involve a dynamic interplay between affective states and cognitive processes.  
- Understanding feelings can illuminate the mechanisms behind consciousness, moving beyond traditional cognitive frameworks.  
- The distinction between perception and feeling reveals the limitations of cognitive neuroscience in explaining consciousness.  
- Evolutionarily, affective consciousness likely predates cortical consciousness, indicating a deeper biological significance.  
- The interplay of arousal and awareness is complex, shaped by both neurological and experiential factors.  
- Consciousness involves a dance between the brainstem and cortical processes, influencing how we engage with the world.  
- Addressing the biases in scientific inquiry could lead to breakthroughs in understanding consciousness and affect.
