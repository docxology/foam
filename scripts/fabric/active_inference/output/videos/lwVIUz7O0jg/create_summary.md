# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Dr. Anna Cia discusses the importance of understanding consciousness through co-embodiment and homeostasis in early human development.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Dr. Anna Cia presents her research on consciousness and perceptual awareness.
2. Her background includes philosophy, cognitive science, and collaboration with quantum scientists.
3. She emphasizes the adult-centric perspective in understanding mind-body relations.
4. Early human experiences are shaped by interactions with other subjects, not just objects.
5. Co-embodiment during pregnancy influences the development of the self and consciousness.
6. Homeostasis is a bi-directional process involving co-regulation between mother and fetus.
7. Active inference theory aids in understanding self-organization and perceptual awareness.
8. The paper challenges traditional views on minimal self and adult-centric perspectives.
9. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in understanding complex systems is highlighted.
10. New insights into consciousness may emerge from studying interactions with other organisms.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Consciousness is influenced by co-embodiment and early interactions with others.
2. The adult-centric view can limit understanding of mind and body relations.
3. Homeostasis and co-regulation are critical in early development.
4. Active inference theory provides a framework for exploring consciousness.
5. Collaboration across disciplines is essential for a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena.
