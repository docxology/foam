# IDEAS

- Active Lab hosted a guest stream featuring Dr. Anna Cia discussing her recent research.
- Dr. Cia is trained in analytic philosophy, focusing on physicalism and the mind-body problem.
- She transitioned from philosophy to collaborating with scientists in quantum science and cognitive science.
- The talk addressed the biases in studying consciousness from an adult-centric perspective.
- Dr. Cia emphasized the importance of early interactions and experiences in understanding self-awareness.
- The traditional view of self-consciousness may overlook the role of multi-sensory experiences.
- A shift from adult-centric to an inclusive ecological perspective can enhance understanding of consciousness.
- The concept of "minimal self" is vital in philosophy, science, and robotics discussions.
- Co-embodiment during pregnancy highlights the interdependence of maternal and fetal systems.
- The interplay between homeostasis and co-regulation is critical for understanding development.
- The predictive processing framework explains how the brain anticipates sensory inputs.
- Early perceptual awareness emerges from interactions between subjects rather than isolated objects.
- The maternal environment significantly influences fetal development and self-regulatory processes.
- Homeostasis in pregnancy involves complex regulatory mechanisms shared between the mother and fetus.
- Active inference helps understand the dynamic interplay between agents in co-embodiment.
- The relationship between body and mind challenges traditional views of individual agency in consciousness.
- Philosophers and scientists need to collaborate to address complex phenomena in human development.
- The dialogue between different disciplines can enhance understanding of consciousness and embodiment.
- Insights from animal behavior can inform our understanding of human cognitive processes.
- The evolution of life forms illustrates the adaptability of organisms to their environments.
- A new framework for understanding interactions in developmental science is necessary for future research.
