# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Live Stream discusses anticipation, affect, and their implications for computational psychiatry and future research projects.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Live Stream 11 is focused on anticipation and affect in computational psychiatry.
2. Future meetings scheduled for December 22nd and 29th will explore related research papers.
3. The community aims to collaborate on a knowledge book and tools for remote teams in 2021.
4. Active inference incorporates anticipation and affect to enhance understanding of mental health.
5. Key terms discussed include counterfactuals, anxiety, and emotional states in various contexts.
6. Anticipation is framed as a central feature of life and decision-making processes.
7. The discussion emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for advancing understanding.
8. The presented research model simulates how overthinking leads to anxiety through anticipated negative outcomes.
9. The paper explores the relationship between uncertainty, affect, and decision-making in emotional contexts.
10. Future research directions include enhancing simulations and integrating insights from other fields.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference can enrich understanding of mental health by incorporating emotional dynamics.
2. Anticipation and affect are crucial for understanding human decision-making and behavior.
3. Collaboration across disciplines is essential for advancing research in active inference and psychiatry.
4. Simulation studies provide insights into how overthinking and anxiety can manifest in behavior.
5. Engagement with the community through feedback and discussions fosters a collaborative learning environment.
