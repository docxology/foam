- Navigating the distinction between realism and instrumentalism can enhance clarity in scientific discourse.  
- Instrumentalism allows flexibility in scientific modeling without the need for strict adherence to realism's demands.  
- Models in science should be viewed as tools for understanding rather than definitive representations of reality.  
- Effective communication requires awareness of how terminology can influence understanding across different fields.  
- The bodyâ€™s expectations can be viewed as adaptive responses rather than rigid models of behavior.  
- Self-modeling in the body raises questions about the necessity of internal representations for bodily regulation.  
- The interplay between expectation and bodily states reveals the complexity of navigating uncertainty in cognition.  
- Abductive reasoning serves as a bridge between conscious thought and the body's instinctive responses.  
- Exploring the concept of Markov blankets can illuminate the relational dynamics between systems and their environments.  
- The development of synthetic systems challenges traditional notions of realism and invites creative exploration in science.  
- Enculturation shapes our cognitive frameworks, influencing how we perceive and engage with the world.  
- The essence of cognition may lie in relational dynamics rather than fixed representations of reality.  
- Models should be assessed based on their pragmatic utility rather than their adherence to correctness conditions.  
- The evolution of scientific language reflects our ongoing efforts to describe complex interactions and relationships.  
- Understanding the nuances of representation can foster interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in scientific research.
