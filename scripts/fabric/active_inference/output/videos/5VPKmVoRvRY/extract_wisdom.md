# SUMMARY
Active Inference Lab hosts a discussion with researchers on the philosophical implications of active inference and realism versus instrumentalism.

# IDEAS:
- Active Inference Lab is an experiment in online communication and learning about active inference principles.
- Participants introduce themselves, sharing their backgrounds and research interests in cognitive science and neuroscience.
- The discussion explores realism versus instrumentalism in the context of the free energy principle and cognitive models.
- Participants question whether models in neuroscience truly represent reality or are merely useful tools for understanding.
- Inactivism critiques the reliance on representations in cognitive science and emphasizes direct interactions with the environment.
- The importance of clarity in communication between scientists and philosophers is highlighted throughout the discussion.
- Realism assumes that models directly correspond to real-world phenomena, while instrumentalism views models as useful for predictions.
- The debate touches on how expectations influence behavior and perception in cognitive neuroscience.
- Markov blankets serve as a framework for understanding interactions between organisms and their environments.
- The distinction between descriptive and explanatory models is crucial in discussions of cognitive processes and neuroscience.
- The role of language and culture in shaping cognitive models and expectations is emphasized by participants.
- The conversation raises questions about the limits of scientific modeling and the nature of knowledge in cognitive science.
- Participants express concerns about how to communicate complex philosophical ideas to broader audiences.
- The integration of various modeling approaches is suggested as a way to enhance understanding in cognitive science.
- A collaborative approach to discussing philosophy and science is advocated to enrich both disciplines.
- The need for a shared vocabulary in discussions of cognitive models is emphasized to avoid misunderstandings.

# INSIGHTS:
- Clarity in terminology is essential for bridging the gap between philosophy and cognitive science.
- The relationship between expectation and reality is complex and often context-dependent.
- Instrumentalism can empower scientific inquiry by focusing on practical outcomes rather than rigid adherence to realism.
- Self-modeling in cognitive processes may not require conscious awareness or explicit representation.
- The interplay between cultural context and cognitive modeling shapes how individuals understand their environments.
- Engaging with diverse perspectives can enhance the richness of discussions in cognitive science.
- The body’s expectations are shaped by its interactions with the environment, informing behavioral responses.
- Active inference serves as a framework for understanding the dynamics of cognition and decision-making.
- Models can be seen as tools for navigating uncertainty rather than definitive representations of reality.
- The success of cognitive models lies in their ability to minimize uncertainty and enhance understanding.

# QUOTES:
- "The majority of the approaches were on the realist camp even those that were coming from inactivism."
- "We can model the brain or we can model the neural activity or we can model cognitive activity."
- "The first question is whether one is licensed to take a realist account from the models."
- "It's important for us to question and think about whether it is actually the case that these two things can be made compatible."
- "The cool thing about Markov blankets is that we can apply them regardless of the scale."
- "Models are never in the brain; models are in the world."
- "We have representations on the agent level; yes on the underlying mechanisms, that’s a different story."
- "I wonder if maybe its expectation is a better word; the body has this expectation."
- "The distinction between descriptive and explanatory models is crucial."
- "If you want to avoid confusion, adapting a language seems to me a far more reasonable approach."
- "The body itself is right there; it sounds very counterintuitive to think that that should need any kind of internal modeling."
- "Our linguistic bodies are a part of the world we interact with."
- "You can technically say we’ll call it something else, but it’s something we all have to agree on."
- "We can use models to understand the data we collect from the brain."
- "Science isn't advancing some noble truth agenda; it's something more on the technological side."
