# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The stream discusses the development and application of an open-source active inference framework for bioregional modeling using Python.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Stream focuses on active inference for bioregional modeling using open-source toolkits.
2. Goals include proof of concept and preparation for the upcoming symposium.
3. Active inference agents control ecological modalities with varying noise and controllability.
4. Ecosystem simulations run random and active inference scenarios for comparison.
5. The biofirm agent uses partially observable Markov decision processes for decision-making.
6. Data visualization highlights differences in ecological variable management strategies.
7. Dynamic simulations provide insights into ecological variable behaviors and management efficacy.
8. The stream introduces potential integrations with digital Gaia and regenerative agriculture.
9. Collaborative efforts focus on open-source development and community engagement.
10. The discussion emphasizes the importance of epistemic and pragmatic values in active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference frameworks can effectively manage ecological variables in bioregional contexts.
2. Simulations reveal the benefits of active control over random strategies in ecosystems.
3. Community engagement is crucial for advancing open-source environmental modeling tools.
4. Understanding the interplay between noise and control is vital for effective ecological management.
5. Future developments will enhance the integration of AI and ecological decision-making systems.
