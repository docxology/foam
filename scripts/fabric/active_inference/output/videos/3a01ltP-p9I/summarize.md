# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
David Benramo discusses computational psychiatry, emphasizing active inference's role in understanding psychosis and the importance of social interaction in treatment.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. A common language is needed in mental health to unify various levels of explanation.
2. Computational psychiatry combines old and new techniques to understand mental health.
3. Active inference minimizes uncertainty in understanding mental states and behaviors.
4. Auditory hallucinations are prevalent in schizophrenia, complicating treatment approaches.
5. Dopamine's role in psychosis is significant but not the sole factor in symptom generation.
6. Social interactions can enhance treatment efficacy for individuals with psychotic symptoms.
7. Negative affect influences hallucinations and delusions, leading to poorer patient outcomes.
8. Longitudinal studies are necessary to validate computational models in psychosis.
9. Patient narratives can inform and inspire research in computational psychiatry.
10. The upcoming International Workshop on Active Inference aims to further this research dialogue.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference is crucial for modeling psychotic symptoms and understanding mental health mechanisms.
2. Social support plays a vital role in reducing the severity of psychotic symptoms.
3. Negative affect significantly impacts the development of hallucinations and delusions.
4. There is a need for empirical validation of computational psychiatry models.
5. Engaging patients in their narratives can enhance therapeutic outcomes and inspire research.
