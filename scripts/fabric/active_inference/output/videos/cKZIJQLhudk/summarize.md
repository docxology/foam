# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Inz Hippolito discusses the concept of Markov blankets in active inference, emphasizing their role in understanding cognition and artificial intelligence.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Inz Hippolito is a lecturer focusing on philosophy of artificial intelligence and 4E cognition.
2. Markov blankets represent the coupling between a system and its environment, influencing its state.
3. An open system is thermodynamically open but operationally closed, allowing persistence without perishing.
4. Active and sensory states facilitate communication between internal and external states in Markov blankets.
5. The Markov blanket formalism can apply to various complex systems beyond just cognitive systems.
6. Modularity of the mind is challenged by evidence of neural reuse and neuroplasticity.
7. The four E's of cognition are embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended, reflecting the relationship with the environment.
8. Active inference models cognition as a dynamic process influenced by the environment and social context.
9. Consciousness is not just a computational outcome but relates to embodied interactions with the world.
10. Future science may evolve to integrate insights from both computational and radical embodied theories.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding cognition requires considering both internal dynamics and external environmental influences.
2. The concept of Markov blankets provides a statistical tool for modeling complex systems.
3. Challenging traditional modularity views can lead to more nuanced understandings of brain function.
4. Emphasizing embodied cognition helps to appreciate the role of social and cultural contexts in mental processes.
5. The ongoing dialogue between different cognitive theories can lead to richer scientific insights and applications.
