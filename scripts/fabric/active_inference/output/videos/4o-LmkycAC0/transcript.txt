foreign [Music] [Music] hello and welcome this is active live stream number 50.2 it's November 3rd 2022 and it's our third discussion on this paper welcome to the active inference Institute we're a participatory online Institute that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference this is recorded in archive live stream please provide feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and will follow video etiquette for live streams head over to activeinference.org to find out more about participating in projects and learning groups all right we are in live stream 50.2 in our third discussion on interception as modeling allostasis as control and we had a DOT zero background in context video and two weeks ago now we had a great number 050.1 discussion so we're just going to have introductions of people who were here last week and then Ian will share something for a few minutes and then we'll be discussing whatever people want so we can each just say hello and anything that we want to explore today or some Reflection from the last two weeks so I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I'll pass to Dean thanks Daniel I am Dean I'm here in Calgary in Canada and uh not much to say other than I'm looking forward to uh getting past the content which was the zero of the context which was the one and figuring out what what we can conceptualize into in the in in this two I'll pass it over to Jordan sure so I'm Jordan I'm a postdoc uh working with the South and Barrett and Karen quickly at Northeastern um and I think I've said the last time that we've done this this paper sort of emerged out of the energetics reading group that we've done so I'm broadly interested in brain energy metabolism I've been doing some other work on that and was not here last week uh in the week between these sessions because I was at the International Conference on brain energy metabolism which was very fun um and yeah I'm I think I'm excited to get to the conceptual details of this paper here too and interest in thinking about what a control theory model of uh of the brain and then the terreception looks like uh and pass it over to Eli Maybe hi I'm Eli I'm the first author on the paper grad student with fion villain vandement who is sort of our under mentioned co-author and with Lisa Felton Barrett and Karen Quigley I would say that I'm I just got away from a conversation with Maxwell ramstead so I'm actually a bit excited about active inference as a he really clarified for me what it is and what it means um yeah and I think I could pass to is that all of us yep or Ian do you still need to go hi yes thank you um so I'm in I'm based in England UK and um so my background many years ago was in kind of uh undergraduate of biochemistry and then pitched in molecular biology applied to immunology and how white blood cells can determine between molecular signals of safety and threat um I didn't stay very long with that moved on to working on Environmental Management projects and um therapy so manual therapy Health mentoring and related things and in that World um a common kind of um theme I noticed was paying attention to bodily signals and sensing interpreting bodily signals but I didn't have a way to talk about that confidently that made sense in with the versions of homeostasis and the autonomic nervous system that I was taught in the 90s so when I a few years ago discovered there was a group of small group of researchers studying interception I got very excited very quickly and I've been involved recently in a little bit of research on interest training for improved interceptive awareness with a university nearby here and when Daniel shared that this paper and said you were it was going to be on the active Insurance Institute I got goodly excited and wasn't quite sure why that was so I said I wouldn't I was trying to figure it out and watching 55.0 and I asked if I could share a few pictures which um maybe I'll do now if I can share screen to oh is that going to be possible sure and I'll crop it so that it's the whole screen okay so um I thought why was I why was I so excited to see this paper I hope it might be able to help people in a therapeutic world because I know that you've sort of talked about physiology meeting engineering but then this is a slightly different um maybe a slightly different take yeah go full screen or just give me once oh there we go to yeah give me one second so um oh is that can you see that now yep I'm just gonna make it big just give me one second to get it finished all right go for it so in the dot zero I heard um people talking about baked in reflexes and it made me think of this these pictures which were have been going around uh on the internet of why oh sorry why are cats scared of cucumbers um is it because they're born with um to be scared of snakes so kind of some kind of genetic you know cucumbers look like snakes so they go from feeding mode into clear mode um or is it that their cruel owners have just put something surprising behind them which um so it's just stimulating a startle reflex either way I don't know what the cat's interceptive experiences but um there certainly seems to be something that it um is automatic is happening there so um thinking about in the therapeutic world there's what's often what we're often trying to achieve is if something is if a behavior has become maladaptive and starts to feel like it's reflexive for a person so let's say a phobia against spiders or a phobia against public speaking or a phobia you know a fear of going into Pub um public spaces then the person may feel like I know I'm going to suffer in this situation it's just a reflex reaction but with interceptive exposure therapy what I find is interesting is that people um are able to in the in a safe space able to say okay when this thing happens to me I feel Maybe short of breath tightness in my chest so if we can recreate that sensation in a safe environment can gradually they learn to change whatever their predictions or their beliefs are about what that sensation means and it seems to work and you know one method of doing that for if breathing is an issue for people and that with anxieties to recreate it by breathing through a straw so the you know the the aim really is to turn something maladaptive into a more adaptive Behavior or a vicious cycle into a virtual Circle so instead of triggering this kind of ought uh reaction which feels unpleasant and is involved you know reflexes or supposed reflexes are being triggered that are linked to shortness of breath or increased heart rate instead so they can um learn to create some changes in the body that might be associated with something more pleasurable such as you know relaxing with family on a beach or some kind of pleasant situation so different changes in that autonomic nervous system and in general what we you know what we are sort of interested in doing is using interceptionism access point to be able to untangle you know the story the thoughts that people have from the situation they're in and the bodily Sensations that they're sensing or that are arising so Dean you mentioned about packing your parachute this was another kind of image that came to mind most babies are probably born with some kind of reaction that stops them throwing themselves out of high places but it does seem to be possible to override any interceptive fear and for some people even to enjoy throwing themselves off high places um likewise we can learn you know we can learn to that situations such as maybe sitting in front of a laptop with an email box full of emails for some people can lead to an interceptive sensation that's like a sinking feeling or a cramping or you know a heavy feeling so then they've learned they weren't born with that but they've learned to associate these situations with something really you know stressful um ah this was from the paper I think uh Jordan or Eli you referred to last year sorry last week the dot one um I haven't digested it fully but it you know it's it's really becomes apparent that the the direction of these circles and the the loops within Loops um are quite quite complex but I really liked the way that you just these are my Reflections now from what where you ended in dot one which was this idea of kind of Cooperative control or optimal control um and you know I was sort of taught about feedback loops as being like thermostats and uh you know maybe fat levels in a person's body being influenced just by the hormone leptin for example um but it seems that the set points in the settling ranges are much more mobile than once was thought and we see that now with you know and involved a lot more crosstalk so rather than just targeting something like leptin as the problem for the Obesity sort of uh crisis then you know this is just to start taken from UK government office which create a CIS an obesity systems map that identified you know 108 interconnected variables that determine people's energy balance in relation to in obesity and some of those things might include marketing and advertising social pressures um so how do we you know how do we bring all of those things in to these types of models that are being created um and then there's epigenetic factors as well so you know people can inherit their exposome through epigenetic changes and can that change their interceptive predictions and you know how I think about this from a kind of Health mentoring or coaching what if this I'm not quite sure if I've wrapped my head around time averaged the concept of time averaging completely but you know if I have someone comes to me and they say we're talking about the health and they want to be healthy enough in 20 years time to be able to support their grandchildren and play with their grandchildren then that's if that's a strong enough interceptive signal of pleasure into the future you know or strong enough desire can that override the short-term interceptive prediction of um Bliss which is may be achieved from some you know very predictably produced junk food that's been designed to create a prediction of you know an interceptive anticipatory um pleasurable sensation how do those over time how do those two different kind of competing desires work with each other is it a battle of will or what you know some of them seem really deeply reflects they both seem deeply reflexive but they are often at odds with each other um and again with this kind of time averaging I was thinking about in in the allotment this isn't from my allotment but um you know plants when they're stressed they bolt earlier and flower early if they think their environment is dry or not haven't got enough root nutrients or enough space for the The Roots then they will flower early go to seed early so um is that what uh time averaging is related to and the other thoughts was about this idea of um someone mentioned about exercise being good for you because it's a short-term stressor and it helps your heartbeat slower over the long term I see lots of sort of people talking about homiesis in the health and fitness and hometric stresses in the health and fitness kind of Arena but we don't seem to have a good model of it or a way of telling what The Sweet Spot is for a hermetic stressor um yes and there's lots of you know people doing hormetic stresses at the moment Wim Hof and hot and cold therapy and so on and the last thing I'm nearly done the last thing that interested me after was this idea of ergonicity and the distinction you made in this paper between our Golic and nanogotic sort of ergotic systems and I was at a park run last Saturday and talking to some of the people my friends at the Finish um about how difficult it is to you know you can feel like you're interceptively feel like you're running really bad one day but then your time is actually quicker than what you expect another day you can be really up for it and excited and feel buzzing and you get to the finish line and realize you've gone slower um this picture is from someone who wrote broke the the world record um achieved a marathon in under two hours and part of the tools in their toolbox was to have a laser to keep their speed constant throughout the the marathon so you know the both at any point either in one instance or throughout the whole Marathon they their time was constant so I guess my question is is technology if if we've if we're trying to design systems based on the idea of ergodicity will are we reverse engineering that into our lives maybe um and where would that lead if you've seen the the film don't look up and it's all about prediction and modeling um What will what will we be evolving into if we don't have you know the right systems that are truly matching uh biological what's actually happening with our biology and um yeah that was they're my reflections that's great awesome Ian thanks for bringing all of that that's really insightful so I think we have more than enough to just begin so let's just start with whoever wants to reflect please Jordan first I mean yeah I guess I can this will be going a little bit off of the paper here but I think just what you were bringing up is is interesting to um some of the other work that I've been doing as well too and what we can think of we can think of sort of extending the systems that we're talking about this paper outside of the body right so some of what you were bringing up was you were talking about um some of the sort of social feedback that you get for um maintaining allostasis um you were bringing up the example of email and the sort of enteroceptive response that you can get from anticipating um stress from from email from communication these sorts of things and you're talking about how there's how external references and you were giving the example of technology and a laser to keep Pace on a marathon can help um can basically act as an external you can use external reference signals right and I think one way to think about social influence or certain some of the social forces on enteroceptive experience is also as like external reference signal Striders at least as external factors and so the um I think one thing so you could think about the the example of the email that you were giving is it's an interesting case right because you basically have um in some ways you're kind of opening yourself up to this import to this portal of potential interceptive disruption that can arrive at any moment and that's not going to be um it's not going to have some of the usual uh contingencies that would allow you to predict it like you would in other cases like if you're going to a meeting did you go into your if you're going to go meet with your boss and you know it's at four o'clock you know that none of the sort of social signals from that that could potentially be something you have to react to something that you have to adapt in a Terrace up the state to something that's going to cause you to have to leverage or basically mobilize your body to respond to that situation those aren't going to happen until about four o'clock when you go to that meeting if you're open to email you're basically going to be able to be prompted within any sort of work hour so you need to be prepared for that potential mobilization at any point right if your boss is like a real you know if your boss is really awful then maybe you're going to get emails in the middle of the night and if that's the case then you need to be prepared for some sort of some sort of allostatic mobilization at literally any point of the day which is going to bring with itself some sort of consequences of needing to have this system in a state of preparedness um because disruptions could come at any point right and so I think the um if one of the principles that's an Eli's paper here right is that we're defining putting together an allostatic response as being [Music] um keeping variables at multiple levels of this control system in a state where they can be maximally responsive to the sorts of threats that could emerge then that's going to look very different if you're constantly in a state where you need to be prepared for a lot of different disruptions that could come in from social sources versus if you're in a state where you could rule some of those things out you know it's the weekend in New York you know your boss or colleagues aren't going to call you and so you can not have to have some of these variables in a state of preparedness to immediately react to those sorts of things right um but that's that's all that made me immediately think of and I think I I could go on and on because I have some other work that's on sort of social social ballastasis or social influence and how we can impact people through that but maybe I should pass over to Eli because I feel like I've I've set you up to think about how maybe this is relevant to to what we're doing right in terms of being prepared for an Adaptive response and how different contexts can can change that right thank you Eli want to go for it I think you're muted sorry I found really interesting the thing with the laser actually and I'm sort of wondering how that how those metabolic trade-offs are taking place in the brain of a runner because you know normally the evidence shows that people will adjust their gait or their running speed to sort of optimize their allostatic Challenge and therefore their energy efficiency and here it looks as though the point of the laser is that you keep the actual speed constant which means you're letting the level of allostatic challenge of the enteroceptive sensations vary a lot or at least a lot more in order to keep the actual speed constant and I'm wondering how this can like how this can happen in the brain like that you construct this alternative sensory variable that you control instead of the interceptive sensations and what sort of where how motivation can be grounded in in terreception to spend this extended time undergoing interceptive challenge but could it also be too that you're because part of part of this right is that we talk about and this was Ian you were talking a bit about um with uh interceptive feed or so in terms of the feedback or the sense of therapies that you can do with this that we you can try to train people to have some more interceptive awareness um on the sensory end of it than they typically or you know to basically attune people to having some enteroceptive awareness and then Eli do you think with the laser Maybe are you giving people you're basically you're giving people something that might be a more High Fidelity like sensory signal like if they're going to try to keep this laser at sort of center of eye fixation they need to move at a certain speed and there's other there's other variables that can follow from something that's more easily tracked in the external environment whereas it might be more difficult to keep on tight tight like sensory control over some of the anteroceptive signals you can you can structure that for people so it's a little bit easier Maybe well I mean yeah I I sorry I was just thinking that the laser um is teaching them to ignore their interceptive signals actually um to place more emphasis on a constant speed required to win than it is on you know oh my you know my legs are feeling a bit heavy or I'm feeling a bit dehydrated or you know um I'm feeling a bit hot so they're ignoring those and focusing more on the outside world um can I just ask a question because I know I always take it from the I'm the real novice here and I think sometimes that that can add something to this what if the laser is has it has an offloading so the top down bottom up that that back and forth that that you guys with your paper really clearly said there's two directions here in this enteroception what if what if the offloading interrupts that back and forth and simply because you're offloading it now you aren't creating that it it it's not it's not external it's it's at it it's added not even as a move a move to that center point on the sigmoid curve it's simply acting as a proxy and and in in in in approximating for you that's taking less energy for yourself now you can consume the calories in running or you can consume the calories in trying to keep things within a range and if you're not burning up calories to try to keep things within a range you can now apply those calories to the running if I could uh give a thought on just that there's so much to add to I'm thinking of where else are there lasers in tasks like running and it makes me think about the task as the offloading that principle of a small task expanding to the amount of time that you have that's more in the cognitive domain like if you have five minutes to write the email you have five minutes if you have an hour you have an hour and then similarly with moving a pile of dirt or doing some physical task when the only thing that's being considered is the decision to do it somebody might surprise themselves with backpacking or undertaking allostatic challenge under the task structure of something that's external so like the laser it's already set versus uh without that desire or capacity to undertake that allostatic challenge it doesn't present itself as an affordance at all so there's just um and then also a really interesting was the note about Ian you added about how some days you feel very good but you're speed or amount lifted might be lower and vice versa so in the models as presented does the entity have a true interception so what is that difference with the experience and performance and Valence of a given allostatic load well I'm not sure I'm I'm not sure if I can answer that question but I think the thinking about one thing that's going to happen if you're going to continue to run for a long time right is that there's going to be certain there's going to be certain motor signals you're going to have to give and there's going to be certain sensory feedbacks that are going to come from that partly in terreceptive information and the problem is that if you're wearing yourself out over the course of a marathon those are going to be moving targets right there's not going to be some consistent amount of force that you're going to need to apply and as your muscle weakens as you're running for longer and longer the amount of force is potentially going to have to change so it's going to become difficult to to keep even a consistent speed right you're going to have to actually vary the amount of force in the actual motor commands are going to have to be given [Music] um and if you don't get [Music] um if a lot of the feedback that you're getting from that isn't isn't especially precise right because you're moving along the road the environment's moving around you it's difficult to get some consistent reference point for it and so what the laser is doing right is it's basically giving you on some sort of constant that you can um that you can regulate in lieu of having to perform the calculations to regulate a lot of other stuff that's changing in your body and over the entire period of it right it's and I think about it in terms of you do a similar thing with like a metronome or something like that as well right where if you're trying to coordinate a lot of different people to perform musical notes in time you'd want to have a conductor you'd want to have um you there's there's a real use in having external reference points for managing those things because literally everything in your body is changing as you're performing this stuff and commands need to be connect commands need to be given to to regulate in the face of all of that change Eli's pointing so I think Eli's got a point um yes I mean I was just gonna say like we know that as you move a bunch of your sensory and interceptive signals change so they're basically never actually constant in the first place if there's something you want to hold constant then yeah you need something like laser that effectively gives you an artificial source of constancy a source of conscious constancy outside the body because you don't have one internally [Music] yes yeah and it's what what's also occurring to me um as you're saying that is as well as the internal conditions changing you know the the external conditions are changing and you know it may be getting windier at various points of the course um and there may be you know uh Daniel you talked about um when we spoke a while ago about ants if they when it appropriate for them to react to weather changes and there may be you know we want a marathon runner to essentially ignore all the weather changes um and just keep running at the desired speed so it's almost um yeah maybe that you know the last slide I put there was a bit of a a distraction really um I don't think it's a distraction at all though but because I think that the no I think it's super super useful because like part of again this whole idea of um multiple variables in the body changing all at once that's kind of core of what we mean when we're saying allostasis right we're saying that there aren't any particular constants that are there there's a lot of variables that are moving and changing and what Eli's making the point in this paper is that in lieu of set points in a lot of those cases what you want is some variables to try to occupy a zone of maximal flexibility to changing circumstances um but at some point like it there might be some variables deep deep down in turn like very very Central to regulating the body that are going to need to be kept at some close to homeostatic level and so one of the things that was coming up for me in working with the brain energy metabolism conference is that variables like blood oxygenation might be one of those right those are very tightly regulated if that Strays outside of some very narrow parameters you're going to have really serious problems but if you think about your Runner running the marathon the um that blood oxygenation level is going to be fluctuating it's going to be challenged there's going to have to be responses or other compromises made in the body to maintain that and if that's the very if that's one variable that's being kept at a type that's being tightly regulated at the core of interceptive information [Music] other compromises that are going to happen to regulate that down the line might be changes in muscle Force delivered changes in speed a lot of fluctuations that are happening in terms of how they're moving their body through this race and so if you're giving them some external external sensory signal to couple to basically at the other end of this control hierarchy that Eli's describing right then you're giving them something at the other end of it to couple to to make their movement through the environment a bit more regulated and predictable so you could think of it as the entire control hierarchy that Eli's describing in this paper we have some very closely regulated terreceptive values far to the left we have a deep net of predictions and prediction error throughout the entire cortex that's performing some regulation um across the entire network and then we have exteroceptive information at the other end of it and what you're doing with the lasers you're basically giving the organism the goal of fixing some of those values at the exteroceptive layer to give some more structure as they move throughout this entire deep deep Network in all the space between it right yes and what I'm thinking also there you know what the marathon runner did before that Marathon so the marathon was made predicted his work his breaking that record was made easier for him by the laser but also you know maybe he influenced his blood his blood oxygenation you know this the upper and lower limits of the acceptable settling range by doing um altitude training to stimulate more um right red blood cells he might have done Hyperbaric therapy um to all those things which will make it easier for him just to follow that later right and I guess an Eli's framework right that would be that's not necessarily changing the settling point of blood oxygenation but what it is doing is at variables that are just slightly levels down from that you're Eli would this be right to say you're basically widening out that sigmoid function so that there's more adaptability um from that additional training for increasing red blood cells that sort of thing is that right yeah definitely I'd also sort of add that some physiological variables are very tightly regulated but one of the open questions is sort of how how many removes are they from a disturbance so like blood oxygenation or the pH in the brain that you mentioned you know what does it actually take to disturb those right like what oxygenation you can probably disturb by just having greater or lesser uptake of oxygen from the blood brain pH I'd imagine that honestly I'd imagine that you have to disturb a lot of things sort of disturb your way through the outer control system like the outer several layers of control systems possible before you can actually perturb that but you can think about things like the fact that you have a blood-brain barrier in the first place is one thing that might help keep that sort of thing tightly regulated right exactly that's what I mean is that yeah you know living systems tend to be sort of homeostatic or allostatic at every level like a cell maintains its own internal you know homeostasis in some sense or allostasis by interchange with its environment then an organ system may also have you know such as the brain may have the blood-brain barrier you know and sort of other levels of protection that insulated from its environment right because it has to be in cooperation with other organ systems for sure and I guess the thing that I'm saying is just that the four for some of those parameters that do need to be really tightly regulated like that right you might see some some uh some naturally developing physiological structures like the blood-brain barrier that are there to help keep those values tightly regulated as opposed to having it be more under behavioral control in which case there's some there's some flexibility there's some allostatic flexibility in those right the what you want is if there's something that really really has to be kept at a certain level you would ideally have some of the evolved biology work to fix some of those parameters in the physiology itself maybe what do you think I'm sorry actually could I just take my dog out for five minutes sorry she's really begging me quite a lot and like the space is getting to me go ahead go ahead Jordan I was just gonna joke about I want to go find a cucumber and try that out of my cat too yeah actually um Terry in the chat wrote Irish cats don't do this there are no snakes in Ireland seriously I've tried it with our cat oh so not all cats well and our cats lived in Doris for her entire life except for the first six weeks or so which was probably blind for half of that so I should try it out on her too and see if there was some learning component to it or if she if she has it innate [Music] sorry dude yeah go ahead Dean I just wanted to kind of throw this in here and I don't know I'm feeling kind of bad because Eli's walking his dog but I'm sure he'll he'll pick up right here so in the in the dot one I brought up this idea and I'm not sure how often it's it's not ubiquitous yet but I I think that the focus in this paper is about perspective swaps so what do I mean by that I kind of want to just do a quick lap around that ergotically and then see what you guys think about this so offloading to a laser as as a perspective uh in the dot zero Daniel saying staying within the connection space as he was talking about CDF to PDF as being another type of perspective taken um the idea of bringing psychologists and their perspectives and engineers and their perspectives together in in an Institute or a lab setting as a as a different type of that different perspectives colliding or at least paralleling um yeah dance dodgeball opposing teams each having a different perspective because they're wearing a different Penny um instrumental that one of the things we would talk about a lot in active inference is instrumentalism and and an action or the idea of um sort of the embodied Space versus the theoretical the map yeah perspective and the territory perspective um and and in this paper's case the specific feedback control Focus as a perspective right what I'd like to do is take that idea that there's all these perspectives that one can be swapped in and swapped up within the idea of Regulation within ranges yes but I'd like to talk a little bit about what Ian brought up which is I think is a really critical point and maybe quite complementary not corollary but complementary to what the paper was talking about you you said if we do something in a safe space now to me I'm going to ask you this to me safe sometimes means controlled meaning the Agents Set the condition or at least they proceed they have some control over that condition okay so that's a perspective that's sometimes perceived as ergotic because it's predictable right then we have a sense of how do we strategize from that set condition one that's variability reduced to one that's conditioned set or variability retained and I use the example that you had on one of your slides which is 108 interconnected variables that determine dot dot dot because to me that's what this paper is trying to focus on that specific feedback control is that shift in perspective that swap between the variability reduced because that's what that's what I said variability retained for me as a skier was I've got an open field it's pristine it's 12 12 inches deep and away I go but as more trees start amassing my ability to be free because of variability my my variability Factor changes and now the ignition set is my pers my perspective swap has to be can I continue or am I just going to end up bashing into a bunch of Limbs right right so the bringing of the two together to me I want to kind of make clear what I mean by perspective swap yeah I don't think it contradicts what you've written in the paper I think the move from CDF to PDF is a perfect example of that perspective Swap and I'm not sure it's just a derivative because as I said in the last live stream you bring you bring psychologists and Engineers into the same space and one doesn't get to rule over the other you need both to create that that swapping condition right right so right is that is that essentially what specific feedback control helps us get a better sense of not just a grip or an optimality but sort of a a clear separation so that we can do the oscillating so that we can do the swapping and so that when we're having these kind of interactions we're not doing a transdisciplinary thing here we're really trying to get our heads around why did the laser work right I think because we can perspective swap that we might get closer to something satisfactory so I'm trying to understand so when you're talking about a perceptive or perception swamp I don't know if I'm going to answer your question satisfactionally we might have to wait for Eli but I'm going to try my best here because I'm not the that's all I want you know because I try my best too that's because nobody's got to be perfect right right and I think but I think that that's part of what factors into what I was gonna how I was gonna try to answer here which is that I think that um foreign so the way I'll try to answer this is I'll try to draw in some of the social some of the social realistic stuff that I've done which is involving more like you're saying interactions between people if we're bringing psychologists and Engineers together this sort of thing so if let's say just if I answered your question right now let's let's pretend that I answered your question in a way that precisely got to the core of it and just stopped the conversation and you just said oh yeah I got it that answers it in a word right then I might have percepted I might have perception swapped slope so closely to the way that you would frame this question and so perfectly understood that the way that you'd asked it right that we don't actually explore the space around it in a way for other people to come in to understand anything of what's going on exactly if I actually didn't totally understand your question I need to ask questions that we need to bounce this back and forth for like several minutes then we might still come to a settling point and we might perform some gradient descent to come to a natural answer here but because it's going to take longer it might end up bouncing around through different parts of the space of answers that we could look at and end up capturing other ways that um other perspectives might be able to understand it right so that they can catch some element of it that was predictable or that fit with some internal model that they'd already generated and then to be able to follow along to the gradient descent to reach down to that point right so I think that part of the advantage right of having interdisciplinary conversations and we've done this a lot especially you know in working with Eli and then working with the engineers at Northeastern these psychology engineer interdisciplinary collaborations right is that there will be a really long and frustrating period where people just do not understand each other um and you need to actually work through that because that's a period where you can do some learning and you can actually get some understanding of other perspectives other ways to build a model of the environment other ways to sort of take a perspective on events that are actually happening but um there will be a Temptation through the entire thing to cut your losses and leave it because it is frustrating and it is metabolically costly I'd say um to do all of that information processing and to follow that process and it's not always obvious when the gradient descent is going to end either or when you do understand each other or when everyone has sort of followed into the loop and you're able to follow that down to make the environment predictable to come to a shared understanding um you know it could have you might know when you're getting close but until you get to that point you might be in a really long and frustrating process of of search prediction error uh of uh of basically bouncing around through the environment of trying to to come up with some model that can predict it right yeah so I feel like that was a very meta way of trying to answer your question but I think does does that help I think there's a I think it gets it part of the use of of interdisciplinary work right and at how we uh how having these different perspectives are gonna help us explore the space more fully because if we if we just had an internal language to each other and if we perfectly understood each other in the first place then like you don't actually end up exploring the space in that case because you descend to you descend to sort of common predictions too fast to to Really bounce around and explore everything you've just you've basically described the capitulation to a retroductive or an abductive logical process that's all you've done and I don't think there's anything to ask you about that it's been around for over 100 years and and I think it's having a Renaissance so thank you cool cool cool oh Ian oh yes as you were talking there about this you know um different disciplines coming together it was reminding me of um one of the active instruments institutes uh papers that were covered a few weeks ago on uh social communication as control I think it was um and also reminding me of you know the difficulty of a newborn child and a parent um you know that all the child can do is cry when it's feels some sort of discomfort and then the parent has to try and figure out what that cry means does it mean it's hungry does it mean it's um nappy needs changing doesn't mean it's too hot or cold so there's a there's a period of learning each other's language and learning what each other's cues are and regulating each other and controlling each other um yeah that's what you know arguably that's all we're doing all the time as as socially as adults we've just got a more bigger set of vocabulary and um we can influence our environment more than the baby well then we can tell each other what our what our expectations are too right like the baby is giving a really diffuse signal that there is some interceptive states disrupted and then the adult has to like we were saying right explore around and bounce around until they can Converge on that and get the baby satisfied satisfy that interroceptive state right but you know if I so some of the other work that I've done is looking at how I really want to look at this paper then of uh of social communication is controlled because that's related to some other stuff that I've been doing too but it's that um I think that you can think of social influence as um basically people regulating uncertainty in a social environment by um conforming to predictions that other agents have in it so you can think of a social Norm as a set of collective expectations that people might have in an environment um and if you conform to those expectations then you can minimize prediction error for people and you can minimize the likelihood that their behavior is going to change that your environment is going to become disrupted more entropic anything like that and so the babies basically creating uh entropy in their environment for the adults in the room to try to minimize by satisfying interceptive needs for them you can as an adult once you can communicate maybe get around some of those problems by saying you know you ask someone to pass the salt of Thanksgiving or pass you know past the butter you've made an expectation extremely clear and then people can satisfy that expectation and everything continues on predictably right they could also refuse and say no I'm not going to pass the song but if you do that you will move things onto a more unpredictable trajectory right you're going to uh push things out of the sort of bounds that people are used to navigating and you're going to potentially move off into this space that's having to explore each other's reactions like like Dean was talking about right yes yeah and what you're sort of saying there it's reminding me of um some of the work so it's a great research researcher called Demetrius ziolet gatas I think he's he's done a lot of work on ritual and um how rituals basically you know he's put heart rate monitors on people and measured cortisol levels and so on over you know the weeks and days following rituals and showing that it's you know there's a lot of synchronization that occurs during rituals um but the the so the synchronization of physiology but it's bound up in these kind of codes or rules about how our plan or our group or our society should operate so it's kind of I you know my interpretation on that is it's training a person's physiology to align itself with social behaviors is this wait was this Demetrius bolus Demetrius um his surname is spelled x-y-g-a-l-a-t-a-s he wrote a book recently called ritual how seemingly senseless acts make life worth living but um yeah he's done some um study with measuring you know heart rate variability and stuff for fire walking kind of rituals and so on that's really cool Jordan you did mention Demetrius bolus and the work from 2020 through others we become ourselves the dialect is the predictive coding active inference also hinging on a shared first name but a very relevance paper as well um and then one thought to connect this idea of synchrony uncertainty controlled novelty in communication and in rituals that's when people are the laser for each other with their attention so then it's like okay we're gonna do a role play where this is going to be the case I'll synchronize this perspective you'll have this perspective will just be like it will be just two stubborn characters having this argument it'll be very funny and then that is a predictable play it could even be scripted or at the very least you can have fun and so on so it's very interesting that that is reflected in the social space whereas the marathoning and going for the record which few people want to do most people can take a much more relaxed approach than the person trying to set the world record but in the social space uh as Dean brought up there's a lot that we can bring to bear on the social space from variability reduced settings like laboratory studies on cognition fmri studies with social stimuli but the social space is a variability retained area of application right and so but we yeah with the translation yes Jordan but but social norms right or sort of some social standards or Mutual expectations add some variability constraint to that social space right because there's nothing physically stopping you from doing a lot of different things in any social setting but the point is that if you want to stay in a variability reduced space and I think that there's some metabolic advantages in enteroceptive advantages to staying in a metabolically returning variability reduced state right then it's just the predictions of other agents that um set some of the bounds of where you'll wander into a variability increase state if you wander outside of those expectations or a variability reduce state if you stay within them right so as long as you're adhering to some predictions that other agents would have in that environment then you're going to stay in a variability reduced State and you can say you can stay for lots of purposes sort of socially invisible to other agents you don't need to create new disruptions to an environment that you're going to need to be prepared to adapt to right thank you Dean sorry I'll blew over my hand again so the fascinating thing about the paper was I used a basic heuristic that says when in doubt and we're pretty much always in doubt zoom in zoom out and so when I when I look at the scale of what that would mean from uh the perspective of interception those time scales are much tighter than if I zoom it out to the allostasis involved in running a marathon my zoom in zoom out range and potential gain is much different for the allostasis than it is for the tarot section that's involved over that same course of time and so that's where I found the specific feedback control which implies that there must be a general feedback control as well so interesting that's where Eli's part about the four different time segmentation possibilities allows for that zoom in zoom out um does that am I contradicting what the point was that you were trying to make in the paper Eli um I'm I am slightly wondering where you got four specific scales well you have The L4 in terms of oh yeah oh that was just for modeling purposes no I understand that but I mean you can still you can still inflate that to yeah yeah but I think that's a pretty standard part of the hierarchical act of inference literature isn't it yeah okay but do you think the idea that again we can swap from from the specific to the general is again it just seems to be again and again it's that ability to move within ranges but but the range doesn't necessarily remain consistent unless of course you're following a laser but that goes back to my original question is because we offload the the metabolic commitment that we would have to stay at that level of consistency we can then turn those resources over to other aspects of that endeavor let me try to ask that a different way to Jordan I think would be um would be how would different patterns in this type of a multi-time scale framing reflect different metabolic or energetic costs like does the brain use more oxygen glucose Ketone bodies micronutrients who knows during what kind of activity such that there's what kind of a link between the physiological costs in gold yeah versus that means cognitive angle I mean I think the way to to do it and this was I think um I was thinking of this when you ask Eli too is that the the trick is right is that if you're regulating um some of the input to the interceptive input that you're trying to regulate that might be really Central to allostatic regulation right could be from sensed and terreceptive variables uh like you know like blood oxygenation like blood glucose but the trick is right is that and this is that I think more what I'm interested in what I'm trying to develop with thinking about brain metabolism is that all of the steps and all of the communication that has to be done at some of these lower orders of this hierarchical scale right isn't free it has metabolic costs itself right and so you know in the human brain the actual resting state cost of the human brain when it's just you're just sitting still in the MRI scanner is about 20 of your body's metabolic budget um it fluctuates a little bit as you're doing some sort of uh as you're doing sensory processing as you're dealing with unpredictable information the details of how it fluctuates like those matter too and we can get into those um there's relative changes in how much glucose you're consuming versus whether you're consuming the glucose with oxygen for like a more efficient yield of of ATP energy but but the point is just that neuronal signaling itself is super expensive and if you're navigating an unpredictable environment then you can expect to have some of those expenses kick up or have them change in ways that are going to have to be regulated so what that means right is that even though there's a hierarchy of processing here where you're taking in sensory signals you're passing them up a cortical hierarchy and you're compressing them if you're doing that more and more and if you're an environment where you have to be passing potentially more and more prediction error up this chain that Canon itself then be changing um important and terreceptive sensed variables that might enter at different points of the hierarchy because there's still sense information but they might be more centrally regulated they might have Downstream effects if those start to go out of whack right so basically I think that it you brought up to that you know thinking about this from an allostatic perspective instead of a computational perspective and I think the computer metaphor that people have been using for the brain kind of computer scientists don't often think about cost in lots of ways too unless you know but they'll think maybe about time cost of how many cycles this like deep neural net is going to take to train but they often don't think about the fact that like all of the components of this computer do take like real energy to run and you know you can heat up the planet mining Bitcoin you can do all of this stuff too there's external there's uh uh external cost to all of this that aren't taken into account when you're actually training these systems the brain can't ignore that because it is an actual biological system and its whole point is that it's going to have to keep that system working navigate the environment and grab metabolic resources to keep the cycle going and so um all of this computation that you're doing yeah isn't free it adds up and then can uh potentially have Downstream effects on on sensed metabolic variables that are critical yeah great thank you Ian uh thank you yeah I was just thinking then after um what Jordan was saying about you know climate change and um that if that's a prediction that's maybe you know two decades ago wasn't gonna affect my life but it might affect the lives of my children or my children's children to act now with that that's a that's a very abstract you know there's probably for most people there was nothing in their environment that would um give them that prediction of future threats in 50 100 years time so they have to create a very you know abstract sort of image of what the planet's going to be like and then to you know all the huge energy expenditure that's required to switch to Renewables to you know organize Society differently that's going to require a massive in allostatic load in the short term or interceptive sort of yeah demand chronic low-level interceptive disturbance to create that shift through generations right and so I think you see right like there's if what your brain is regulating is at the core that some of the interceptive parameters that are necessary to keep your body and your polar organism moving forward right then being thrown into a constant state of uncertainty is going to be costly if we think it's true that processing all of that uncertainty is going to have a metabolic cost attached to it and so there's going to be some I think the way that that your sort of brain as a regulator is going to work is probably going to want to return you to some relatively predictable State and so the issue right is that if you're if you require if you could if you could model and understand externally right like if you can understand that in a long that the long-term trajectory that you're on in terms of climate change is going to lead to disaster right it can still be really difficult to divert from that because the trajectory is at least is a predictable trajectory that you're on until it hits some of these critical exponential points where it's suddenly going to break right and so I think you could see that with climate change I think you could see that with the pandemic you can see a lot of cases where there's um there's a temptation to return to some sort of trajectory where when things are going moment to moment they're relatively predictable they don't require a relatively large amount of attention um and if you're going to enter into some uncertain change state I think you there's going to be a sort of collective pressure of a lot of brains regulated themselves to get back onto some predictable trajectory right you can't sustain like complete uncertainty for a really long time because I don't think our brains can handle it so I would have to ask uncertainty about what uncertainty about the immediate lived environment so what's going on around you what are you doing when I got up today like I made coffee I got on the computer I have a predictable set of sensory signals that I'm going to be running into I have yeah yeah like a daily routine these things I don't mean yeah yeah because let's see so what was it climate change pandemic so you know most of these are not actually things that make your day-to-day life that unpredictable that's exactly what I'm saying I'm saying that those long-term events those things that you might be worrying about those things you know that we're talking about being worried about climate change they don't actually impact your day-to-day life right now very much and so changing your day-to-day life substantially now to deal with them is going to be difficult that's all I'm saying well not necessarily because the reference trajectory for actually dealing with them is not necessarily that unpredictable either different from what you're already doing doesn't mean unpredictable it's true but the period where you shift what you're doing to something different is and so I guess what I'm saying is that A change is something that requires a difference in trajectory from where something was already gone yeah but I think the thing about so the thing about our trajectory based formulation of allostasis is that well the whole point is that you know if you let's say you plan to go to the store you're driving on the road you make a right turn is the right turn unpredictable no it's not it's a predicted baked in part of the reference trajectory change does not have to be unpredictable and I think we should avoid conflating those two sure can I can I bring these first yeah a couple of examples of things we talked about in the dot zero so Daniel brought up a really interesting point when he talked about um glucose stacking and I I automatically sort of brought me to the idea of people who are have diabetes and those that are uh I think it's hypoglycemic unawareness they're the most brittle diabetics um and essentially what that speaks to is they have a large blind spot to sort of the cumulative effects of what's going on because the pancreas isn't working correctly doing that kind of Regulation piece that blind spot and the and the severe consequences of that point but again I don't want to beat this like like a dead animal but because you are blind to something implies that you cannot take up that perspective and then the consequences of that are more severe when you absolutely don't know how your body is going to respond to that donut or not right so again it's it's we talked about it in the in the in the context of it Jordan was really good and clarifying we can't think of this in economic terms but I think we can think of it in terms of blind spot terms if we have a blind spot to this how do we respond to it how do seven billion people respond to it if well what they do is they revert back to the to the now that's what they do about their blind spot right because they just don't want to take up the perspective swap because it's way too challenging they might also sense there might be you might think of it also to write in this control hierarchy of that um if you're missing uh an ability to sort of sense and regulate some parameters in the hierarchy there might be Downstream consequences of of glucose use that can be sensed but the problem is it's going to mean that you don't have as tight control you're basically like you're saying you have a blind spot in that hierarchy that isn't as tightly regulated and so it could potentially wander out of some of the bounds that are going to be uh adaptive or safe because you're performing some sort of second order control on it instead of um controlling it more tightly with some of the senses that you would normally use right yeah but what do you think Ela if I could just give one quick response actually on this idea um The Leverage point of the control system is the true control variable so beyond being a good regulator having a volume knob in your head if there's a volume knob in the generative process the ultimate control situation is to just have the actual control of the volume knob and there's cases where that's possible there's case where it's not but where it is possible it's the leverage point and then Jordan you just pointed to if you're missing this ability to either um sense X like we can't directly perceive our glucagon circulating level or responsivity across different tissues it's just too multi-faceted and subliminal of an enteroception directly different hormone balances and so on though technology and measurements are increasingly allowing that to be laser focused without the ability direct to directly control those subliminal factors to either sense or act on them we can only apply upstream or Downstream control so we could modify our niche or use signposting or stigma G so that our environment dissuades us or makes something impossible like time boxing or just putting something away or Downstream consequences like if like um having um a some kind of supplement that helps with lactose digestion so we can't regulate most you can't put oxygen in the blood simply you can't simply change amount of cholesterol and so actually being able to have a framework such as you're describing where we can talk about the true physiological variable the actual substance of the essential variable but also recognize that we're only going to have interceptive access into potentially noisy or variable proxies that are influenced by many things and they're going to be like sometimes multiple steps up or Downstream like lightheadedness in the context of glucose regulation but that can happen for a lot of reasons so it can't be simply the cue so really interesting there um Eli or anyone else so I think we have to differentiate between how could you build an active inference control system in general and how are nervous systems built in specific how how our nervous system is built in specific is an empirical question and I have pretty strong doubts that it's all just a matter of Leverage through pretty much the same reason that I have my doubts about it's all about avoiding change like there's just such wide variability of behavior in real life there are people who Embrace change there are people who challenge themselves you know there are people who give up some of their leverage or control over some things and if we don't look at those if we sweep those actual behavioral instances under the rug of a sort of General principle that says well everyone ought to be very controlling and conservative all the time then I can't help but think it's a sort of scientific sin so so you like Dean and I were talking when you were out too about um by the way um normally she's a bit more allostatically resilient but she might be ill oh I hope she's feeling better we but we were talking about because I think that maybe maybe there's a misunderstanding because I don't think that we're saying that people only want to control or make their environments perfectly predictable right I think um part of what we were talking about right we were talking about this idea of Shifting perspectives or this idea of [Music] how do uh so you're coming at it from the perspective of what a collaboration between psychology and Engineering really gets you in the first place even right and what we were talking about is that part of what it does if people have the goal of trying to understand each other at the end of it and reach some sort of mutual predictability right so that they've developed some understanding that they could build a forward model from that they can actually uh they have a model of um of the environment that incorporates some understanding from the the other collaborator right there's going to be a period of that where you don't necessarily understand each other super well and there's going to be a long period of speaking to each other and not totally making sense and having to ask a lot of questions and having to search the space and what we are talking about is that from the perspective of fully exploring a space to actually develop a complete model of it or at least a better model of it there's actually some advantage of not having things um quickly achieve that predictability for each other if you quickly just gravitate you know if I answer a question and the other person just like immediately understood what I meant by it it might be because you know I answered it in a way that just happened to nail it for that one person but no one else in an audience is going to be able to understand it no one else who's listening in is going to be able to understand it and so by having some sort of imperfect process of gravitating towards making things predictable for each other you know we actually achieved some more explanation exploration and we sort of get a better sense of the space that we're actually moving through and we might generate a better model than we would if we just immediately converged right yeah of course but I think yes oh sorry I'll go ahead BYU raised the difference between these two questions how is the nervous system built in specific or in particulars and how can you build or what is an active inference model in general so maybe return to the top question um sure yeah so I think this is one of those things that can get a little conflated when we have these collaborations of psychologists and engineers where from the engineering side if you're building something for uh so to speak the other acronym that you can form out of active inference you know AI instead of active then you don't want something that works like a human nervous system necessarily well you may want to share you know a few properties but actually you're building it to solve some sort of task or to exhibit some sort of relatively well-specified behavioral routine and therefore it's going to be in most respects very completely different from a human being and that's actually not just because you're trying to avoid um what is it rossum's Universal robots right where of course those were actually made of flesh and blood like it's not because you don't want your computer to grow feelings and decide to go on strike it's because apriori there's no reason to build a machine that works like a person in the first place maybe it would decide to go on strike but you know the space of things that you can build is just so much larger that what you would usually do as an engineer is just aim towards the point of the space that you actually need for your task and that also implies a sort of Converse proposition which is that the human nervous system is a pretty specific point in a space of things that could have evolved or even in the space of things that did evolve you know human being versus what is it it's not a sponge it's that sea organism mentioned in the one of those Christian papers that you know when it goes through a certain life transition it latches itself down onto a rock and goes through a little stage of metamorphosis where it eats its nervous system yeah C squirt thank you man [Music] like those both evolved there is some space of possibilities that includes both the c squared and the human being this implies that it's a pretty broad space of possibilities and if we're using active inference to model them both this implies a very very large space of possible active inference models formalisms controllers so um Eli uh if I've heard you correctly they you you're sort of saying that artificial intelligence or tools that humans make um that might be modeled may or may not be modeled using active inference um they you know there's usually a an outcome or a goal that's that that we that's quite clear why we build them so it might be I don't know I want to build a coffee maker to make me coffee um and I might use some you know very intelligent um methods to to build that coffee machine but the out the outcome is clear seems to me that with the nervous system we're still not clear on what the outcome is so if it's you know if if the fep is right then it's just to minimize free energy minimize surprise but am I right you're sort of questioning whether that is the that is the cup of coffee we're after at the end um yeah and so we always have to sort of remember that dog walker just got here um we always sort of have to remember that surprise means under a certain generative model and so the models that are present in free energy can involve sort of epistemic value you know like uh what's it called verisimilitude to the sensory world accurate modeling they can also involve a reference trajectory and so they can also you know they can involve both perception and action and that's a really broad space of things why are they doing like surprise doesn't mean a minimized surprise doesn't mean avoid change it means minimize you know it means optimize this information theoretic functional whose meaning is actually pretty strictly mathematical and is the is the outcome always to be Auto poetic so to make another nervous system I mean is it like I don't know that's what I'm wondering I would think it usually is if you're making a coffee maker it probably isn't like profit makers sometimes you have to disassemble them slightly to replace the parts or to clean them and so you don't necessarily want it to be self-organizing in the sense of trying to what like make another carafe when you take the carafe away to wash it foreign but I think that if Ian's asking about other places he's asking about is this something so you're you're making a distinction you lie between a living and a non-living system or between a living system and a tool that you've made to give it a certain input and give a certain output back right so so is maybe just to repeat this question you know and say for a living system then do you think that some of the fundamental control variables here are are Auto poetic and there I think I have to say I don't know because I am not a biologist and I haven't seen the full range of weird stuff that other organisms do and I want to be very very cautious about the idea that we can sort of introspect gather what we think are a few general principles of human behavior and you know as as introspections go they may be pretty good ones and they may generalize pretty broadly and then expand that to the entire rest of the kingdom of living organisms like the entire rest of the Tree of Life so just as an easy counter example there are insects that die when they mate this is an ordinary baked in part of their life cycle and you know if you want to talk about that as Auto auto pieces then I think we have to Auto police this then we have to ask what is being self-organized the parent or the child because the parent empirically is being disorganized that's fair I mean I oh sorry not Dean you should go first I'm I'm I'm just as happy listening but I'll just throw this in here because I I don't know if Eli would describe it this way I'm certain he wouldn't but I always like to introduce new ideas I've always said that if we're talking about living math now don't make me Define that if we're talking about living math math that's a lie that's much that's to me easier more easily described as a leap of faith embedded within a step function rather than being provided the functional requirements as a case use and then building the Algos to carry that through that's a very clear difference between the two things one is a bridge and the other is we all get in a bus build a ramp and then fly over the The Divide and then if we're really good and we land it we go back the other way and go because we're still allostatically and homeostatically existing but I I to your point I think we have to be clear that those two things are quite different one is a lie and the other is not and both require math but not the same math and even among I would actually caution even among living systems living involves metamorphosis it involves Death at a certain point it involves reproduction it doesn't just involve individual survival that is not how an ecosystem works no for sure and I think what I was just going to add was that I think from an auto poetic perspective I don't think anyone would disagree with that I think that what someone would say is that you need to think about on from a perspective of reproducing the relationships that create an organism reproduction in that process right could be a process of recreating the organism and recreating the structures that create that organism when there's components of it that couldn't be they couldn't be repaired without reconstructing the entire thing basically right so you have um you'll have death you'll have any one of these systems are going to have components of it that can't be can't be repaired and if if parts of it can't be repaired then a way of basically ensuring that that system continues to exist in the in the relationships that compose it is to reproduce and create a new system that has those relationships but has the parts that are going to terminally fall into disrepair over a certain period of Time start fresh so we can begin that cycle again right that's actually an empirical Claim about the evolution of Aging which is that aging came first you know at say the Single Cell level and then reproduction follows to cope with that and I don't know enough about the history of life to know whether that's true or not if I could connect this very interesting theme to Dean's Bridges and ramps which are two different engineering projects and have two different sets of uh structures to modify the niche with and also Ian's original point about the epigenome and the exposome and taking ecological Developmental and evolutionary perspectives on human health so um the process of epigenetic canalization and the way in which epigenetic variability can become entrenched through genomic changes like one protein that has um a bi-functional aspect over evolutionary time when that region undergoes some chance duplication that could allow those to Tandem proteins to Diversion functions and like sub specialize because there's a new capacity in the genome for the coding sequence to take on some of the responsibilities that had been taken by a protein modification or some other dual functionalization of the ancestral protein so the bridges are on the Continuum towards modifying the environment modifying the anatomy to embody the constraints of the environment like the buoyancy of a fish something where the anatomy even without going into the morphological computation angle just the scale of the femur is such that it ends up being able to do plausible actions which gets you in the ballpark by being that kind of thing and then Behavior takes us closer and closer to that person jumping off the plane that Ian showed whether it's like one footstep which is many times a challenge for all kinds of various regions I mean it could be really anything and that's kind of the challenge of of movement to the social risk settings and people having different profiles or envelopes of their risk in different areas of being alone and being with other people all these different settings um but those are more ramp-like because in the end especially when it's socially extended you can't have the actual bodily you can't embody the content of social variability but your your physical body can embody the content of being regularized with the abiotic niche but the brain can only be prepared in a way that you know is different from the body hope that kind of brought it back to that epigenetics angle because behavior is even more Epi than epigenetics and so allostatic are changes that are faster than it so it makes sense to put it within a broader evolutionary perspective on how our priors got honed in to even this modality well in our last um 25 minutes or so where do we go from dot two either the researchers or Ian wherever you feel um the point you made Daniel about evolutionary I you know I didn't mention evolutionary biology specifically at the beginning but um for me that seems like a um maybe a blind spot here um you know I'm thinking also about Markov blankets and if you you know got my gut microbiome um influencing my you know the um neurotransmitters that I produce and do I do I include my gut microbiome in within my Markov blankets and if so you know what am I feeding my gut microbiome do I include the food that I'm selecting within that Markov blanket and if so do I include the fields that the food is growing in um because that will affect the food and if so do I include the microorganisms in the in the soil because that affects the how the food and then that will affect the microbes of my gut and that'll affect me and then do I look at the weather so you know it's it's more of a kind of communion communion of subjects rather than um bound objects but we have to start somewhere so it has a bit of a jumping off from that I think with all the active inference work there's always this incredibly important question which is we can use the framework across so many different scales you know I just had um Maxwell ramstead tell me that they derived a theorem that literally every physical system has a Markov blanket and then I asked him well how do you pick out the ones that were interested in studying and he said sort of you know basically he said well there isn't necessarily a theorem directing you to the most interesting you know or a metric that tells you which ones are interesting so that's still in the realm of just of an investigator's choice and I think you know there we really have to figure out how to ask when do we think we're going to get something interesting out of applying this framework to a given object of study or to a specific object of study and when do we think we'll be doing something sort of like rederiving evolution [Music] where like it's useful to do as a formal exercise but to my knowledge we haven't learned anything new about Evolution from the free energy principle or active inference that we didn't know before mainly because people had already described evolution in terms of inference you know prior to describing it in terms of active inference I I think another another thing that's useful to think about and I've been thinking about this a lot lately is in terms of what are some of the metaphors that we're using to scaffold the scientific questions that we're asking um because I think one of the things that one of the things that's a big strength of this paper of Eli is right is that the title itself is actually a sequence of two metaphors which is interceptionist modeling allostasis as control so I think there's a sense that um if we have particular question you know if we set ourselves up to think what is the um what's the sort of framework that we're using for thinking about the questions that are interesting or not as Eli's saying what are the systems that are interesting what sort of metaphor is a Markov blanket what sort of metaphor is active inference what are the sort of things that these are directing us to look at and does thinking of control um in the way that this paper has been doing direct us in a different direction to think about things in like a slightly different way maybe can I tag on that right away yeah can I get your response to this Jordan so it's the metaphor consistently is one of the elements baked into the metaphor non-continuity meaning whether it would build a bridge over it or whether we all leap across the creek hand in hand and then the second time we do it we all go we because we did it twice and now we have some no confirmation that we can do it it's the is the consistency within the metaphor the non-continuity I know we perceive it sometimes as being continuous and Progressive but are we talking whether we're talking Markov blanket or whether we're talking anything that's gap respecting is not necessarily Gap filling that's my question to you Jordan what do you think I think it's I think it's more about the Gap respecting than the constantly searching for something to jam and wedge in it because that that space that that Eli spoke to that that possibilities thing that really matters in terms of Staying Alive right it's not when you're getting out of the particulars Max ramstead says there is no rule for that yet that's that's what you have to self-organize so what do you think I don't know I don't know how to answer that I'm trying to familiarize feel but but what I but I guess um so then Jordan I think you should prep what you're saying for a moment and I'll give an answer to that for sure or you just take over so I think the thing is that at least in our lab we are a physiologically focused affective science lab right and so we sort of come to active inference with a set of systems of interest and a set of phenomena of interest in mind already and that doesn't necessarily help other people pick out what they want but it does indicate that you can bring what you want to I think active inference ends up being a bit of a potluck feel at a certain point that's a good answer yeah yep one thought on that is the structure of a lab with a system or a question in mind is uh epistemic framework that allows the investigators to actually take on bold's new theoretical choices and explore different Frameworks that are investigating a specified system of Interest like we're studying blood pressure regulation in the context of professional dodgeball players or interceptive awareness in intramural dodgeball players when there's already a project or a need specified in potentially even variability retained setting then the lab exists to funnel that into different kinds of analyzes and scenarios that help address that system like all of the lab studying different human diseases and sometimes and with challenges and successes making their work in the lab connect back to the real world and being able to take on new theoretical perspectives some which might not initially appear to be helpful until years of basic research have occurred around some molecule or Gene family so yeah that's very interesting what Maxwell added and I think speaks a lot to many of the Notions that we've been discussing like pushing at not having two Realms the metabasian with a highly rule-based and then leaving the outer level with where there is no strategy we just accept the priors without having metacognition on that level because that's just the limits of how far the model was extended out yep um do other review Author just want to add anything about dodgeball well yes yes I was going to tell I was going to tell everyone why it was DodgeBall so um essentially in basketball you have to shoot To The Hoop so you throw the ball goes it either goes into the hoop or it misses if you're passing you know the person either catches or you missed in DodgeBall the ball is coming at you and so the idea here is that you're picturing yourself trying to dodge and this lets us sort of merge the intuitions about predictive processing and control where the reference signal is to avoid contact with the ball so therefore the stimulus becomes both a prediction error and an actual control error foreign dodgeball with something I mean if you walk out into the middle of a traffic yes like there's always some obscure possibility of being you know hit by a rock out of nowhere but hopefully most of the time in life you're not actually playing dodgeball with something well there's always something that can disrupt you right yeah there's always I don't know do you have a system that can be disrupted in many ways I'm just picking on it because I think again it's it's about metaphors right and I think when you're talking about basketball you're talking about having a goal you're talking about having um some sort of externally defined goal that you're trying to perform actions to satisfy and then you tally up the score in some way of it right versus in Dodgeball you can get hit and you're out and you know the same thing is true of your your physiological systems can get disrupted and you're out you're dead right yeah but I guess my intuition is that in DodgeBall the ball is coming for you in a way that most of the time it isn't physiologically no that's true metaphors aren't perfect but I'm just saying that yeah this physiology is not adversarial no no but there is yeah oh no sorry go ahead just remind me at each sport provides kind of a difference metaphor none of them total or of course exact but there's games where you're avoiding the ball there's games where you have to hit an inanimate object and then it bounces off like ball ball um there's games with implements without implements there's marathoning they're sprinting there's throwing things then there's just one two three eleven all numbers of different players on ice as Dean knows and each of these settings have their interceptive challenges and social included in that model Dean yeah I was just going to say the metaphor you can have you can have a lattice of rope that makes you a bridge and you can have a lot of rope that makes you a fishing net one captures one allows you to cross one is in between one is enveloping and I think that's why we use metaphors but at the point that I would make is that when you mesh something you still have those gaps and I think it's important to see the non-continuity in this I think that's where the math the theoretical the ability to bring it down to that level if it's not if it's not only one if it's not received as only being one math if there are maths involved I think you create the conditions around which better understanding can move forward now to Jordan's point it takes longer if you don't have the proper gauge of mesh to catch the smaller fish and that's I think what Maxwell was speaking to it's up to you to decide whether you're catching Guppies or tuna there's a there's your metaphor for the daytime one short thought is the a zero to one which is a boundary we can talk about in the future is um when the entire or large subsets of the active inference ontology and frankly just the use of statistical modeling these kinds of Transformations are not 2022 sanesh at all inventions with respect to control processes um once one undertakes the statistics toolkit they enable new visibilities into what was already latent every time somebody had shown something in terms of a CDF they didn't always show this but this is also taking logs of variables and interchanging CDF and PDF some of these Atomic units already exist and this paper does an incredible job of putting the setting of interception and the function of allostasis into the intersecting legacies of control theory and cybernetic approaches as well as more recent developing threads many of which don't have a formal basis initially like ecological psychology and affective modeling and so bringing those two areas together is kind of that psychologist engineer conversation that was brought up and that's like the dodgeball game now are they throwing if they hit each other do they knock each other out or are they sending each other you know and as we explored initially it's not clear and the in that uncertainty in the beginning of the exchange it's not like the dodgeballs are particles they're more like waves what will Jordan and Eli your post paper directions be or how long are you going to be continuing or what directions here Jordan I think you should tell them about our lab meeting next week oh yeah we're we're covering um so I think one of the things is we've talked about uh controlling variables here we were interested in um or I'm interested at least in thinking about a for other control perspectives there's a perspective perceptual control theory um to think about whether the uh that basically the behavior is a means of um controlling inputs or controlling sensory inputs to a system but more specifically I'm interested in um thinking about how we can apply Control Systems thinking to Neuroscience more generally so I think people are very used to taking an fmri image for example a bold Imaging and then treating it as an input output system where they deliver some sort of stimuli to the brain they'll observe some output which will be a bold response in some region and then they'll interpret that as causal that they deliver a stimuli they see an effect in the brain and they have to they've identified some cause effect relationship and the problem is that people have been doing that for 20 30 years now you have a million different strands of these supposed cause effect relationships and you don't have a whole lot to structure them and a different way to think about it is that the brain is um is a negative feedback controlled system that's trying to regulate some uh homeostatic variables within it or allostatic when we consider them in the context that we're doing so if we deliver some sort of stimulation to the brain we're basically perturbing sensory input to it and then we're seeing some perceptual response or we're seeing some restabilization within the brain to bring it back to homeostasis within a region um and we're not really getting it causal relationships we're looking at control systems that are being perturbed so that's coming off of the chapter that was by Henry Yin called the crisis in Neuroscience which there's also really great on brain inspired podcast episode about that too which is worth checking out of and Eli you have some ideas too to follow up to think about um control and affects right yeah so um us to start with that I would sort of make a small Amendment to the notion of a negative feedback control system um Jordan can you catch the podcast link yeah sorry I could okay I know I've got it um and say you know maybe we should be thinking about nervous systems as mixed feedback control systems so sometimes you need to stabilize a state of sensitivity to the environment rather than resilience against the environment and that would involve positive feedback and that's sort of where I get into thinking about affect is that you know if you say that there's sort of these two modes of control positive feedback stabilized control for states that are very sensitive to the environment and then negative feedback purely negative feedback really it's positive feedback in the service of negative feedback over the long run and then purely negative feedback states that are trying to be insensitive to the environment and you have failure and success or either of them and all of a sudden it sort of starts to look and you can structure the feedback loops in different ways it starts to look more like some of the core properties of affect that jump out in our data and sorry that's a very hand wavy explanation and it's because like we really don't have like I don't have this in the form of more than a few notes on my iPad but there's should I link the other brain inspired episode yeah yes like that that one's good enough that I included a quote from it in I think in my slides from here that we had it's the Rudolph yes yeah yeah controllers to engineering what philosophy is to the humanities wow wow very interesting directions Ian and Dean what are your next research and education directions um I'll go first I'm gonna listen to those podcasts this is my next steps and I've just really enjoyed this conversation and um what I think you're all all trying to achieve is amazing stuff and it's whether it's whether um studying humans is going to help us make better AI on robotics or whether attempting to make better you know engineer better machines is going to help us understand humans or whether you know we're gonna as you said Jordan bounce off each other and improve our understanding both ways I think it's um it's a good thing foreign thanks Ian thank you Ian thank you Eli thank you Jordan always thank you Daniel I I think um I think the last two and I want to thank Dave Douglas although he's not on a tile today as well because he was there for the um dot one it's it's really rewarding you when you can actually have a conversation with people like I mean normally it's throw out the the Dodge balls and then if you had this conversation in that in that space you know it would basically be yelled out of the gym so they could get on with the game and then there's these people that would actually want to figure out well what's really going on here you know besides the person that leaves and has to get the ice pack because they got hit in the head or whatever and I think the I think the idea that a bunch of individuals can sit down and have one of these perspective swap sessions because they're all really good translators in their particular area of focus really it kind of changes the idea around what we've been doing and we're trying to do an active inference which is you know create create a bigger tent create a sense that people with different backgrounds don't have to feel strange because they don't well I don't know as much about active inferences Max Randstad so I'm going to spend ten thousand hours to have a conversation about this that's not what we're about what we're trying to do is pull a bunch of people into the room and let them translate together swap those perspectives actually go away as Ian said I mean I'm going to go away now and figure out what why really why does this laser idea work not just sort of in a hypothesis in my brain but really go away and think about that for a bit and I think if we can do that more um and uh you know semi-formal way you still have to cover the content and you still need to get the contextual background but to get to this place where we are today Jordan to your point it takes time but man the rewards and the payoffs it's just huge and again again Daniel all the work that he puts into doing this it's just it's awesome so thank you thank you yeah this is really fun yeah great conversation so really appreciate it also as always all right till the dot three anytime you or anyone else want to continue or present any other time always welcome so farewell thank you very much bye awesome thanks
