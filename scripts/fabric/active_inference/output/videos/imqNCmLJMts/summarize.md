# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter one discusses active inference theory, contrasting high road and low road approaches while exploring concepts like surprise, free energy, and perception-action dynamics.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference theory provides a framework for understanding perception and action in organisms.
2. The high road approach assumes the existence of "things" and their requirements for agency.
3. The low road approach generalizes Bayesian reasoning using concepts like free energy.
4. Active inference integrates perception and action, treating them as interconnected processes.
5. Variational free energy serves as an optimization parameter to minimize surprise in perception.
6. Approximate Bayesian inference simplifies complex real-world situations compared to exact Bayesian inference.
7. Normative aspects of active inference relate to free energy as an evaluative standard.
8. The chapter sets the stage for exploring high road and low road differences in subsequent chapters.
9. Discussions include implications of active inference in psychology and psychopathology.
10. The concept of relevance realization emphasizes the importance of parameters for modeling behavior.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference combines perception and action into a unified theoretical framework.
2. Understanding high road and low road approaches is crucial for grasping active inference theory.
3. Variational free energy is key to approximating Bayesian inference in complex environments.
4. Normative standards in active inference provide a metric for evaluating agent behavior.
5. Future chapters will expand on the foundational concepts introduced in this chapter.
