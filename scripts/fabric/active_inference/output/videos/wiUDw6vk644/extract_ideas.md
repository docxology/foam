# IDEAS

- Actinflab is an online participatory lab focused on applied active inference discussions and learning.
- The discussion centers around the paper "psychophysical identity and free energy" by Alex Kiefer.
- Participants introduce themselves, sharing their backgrounds and interests related to the paper.
- The conversation explores the contrastive divergence process in relation to generative models and identity theory.
- Cynicism is referenced in discussions about continuity and discontinuity in philosophical thought.
- The three functions in contrastive divergence are discussed as processes that involve identity and inversion.
- The paper aims to connect psychophysical identity with models of active inference and free energy.
- The Helmholtz machine serves as a foundational example for understanding generative models in cognitive systems.
- The concept of equilibrium and non-equilibrium is central to discussions about brain function and dynamics.
- Predictions in active inference can be framed as inferential processes related to sensory experiences.
- The role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation and memory retrieval is linked to generative modeling.
- The relationship between attention and mind wandering is explored in the context of cognitive processes.
- Participants share insights on how generative models can inform understanding of mental states like depression.
- The conversation touches upon the implications of predictive coding for agency and decision-making in cognitive systems.
- The discussion highlights the potential for cultural scaffolding to influence cognitive and behavioral dynamics.
- Future research directions include exploring the implications of these ideas in practical applications and deeper theoretical frameworks.
