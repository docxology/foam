# IDEAS

- The live stream on June 8th discusses the paper "Embodied Skillful Performance Where the Action Is."
- Active Lab is a participatory online space for learning and practicing applied active inference.
- The purpose of the discussion is to explore the paper and engage with the authors.
- Introduction of participants and warm-up questions are part of the live stream etiquette.
- Active inference is a generative model that evolves over time and doesn't have a final form.
- The paper critiques instructionist control theoretic models of skillful performance.
- A key distinction is made between instructionism and interactionism in understanding skillful actions.
- Interactionism allows for a richer understanding of motor actions beyond simple instructions.
- Instructionism assumes a directional flow of information from brain to body, whereas interactionism emphasizes bi-directional communication.
- Active inference does not rely on instructionist assumptions about motor representations.
- The paper examines how skilled performance utilizes knowledge about movement rather than strict instructions.
- The concept of "harnessing knowledge" raises questions about conscious versus automatic actions in skillful performance.
- The debate exists on what constitutes skillful versus unskillful performance.
- The discussion includes how cognitive processes influence motor behavior and skill execution.
- The paper outlines the limitations of traditional control theory in modeling skillful actions.
- A focus on the generative model allows for a more nuanced understanding of actions and sensations.
- The authors propose that skillful performance encompasses intelligent bodily activities that adapt to context.
- The relationship between cognitive processes and motor actions is critical for understanding skill execution.
- The distinction between optimal motor control and active inference is a central theme of the discussion.
- The role of attention and awareness in motor performance is highlighted as a key factor.
- The conversation touches on the importance of collective behavior and interaction in skillful actions.
- The potential for curiosity and exploration in learning processes is emphasized.
- The paper critiques the notion that all control activity must be cortical, advocating for a distributed model.
- The discussion includes the implications of optimal control theory for understanding complex systems.
- The concept of solenoidal flow is introduced as an important aspect of active inference.
- There is a critique of the reduction of multiple values into a single scalar for decision-making.
- The integration of environmental factors and resource management is discussed in relation to active inference.
- The dynamics of learning and forgetting within skill acquisition are explored.
- The importance of embodied experiences in learning processes is emphasized throughout the discussion.
- The conversation concludes with an acknowledgment of the evolving nature of understanding skillful performance through interactionism.
