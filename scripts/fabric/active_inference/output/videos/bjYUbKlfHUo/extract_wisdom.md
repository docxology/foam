# SUMMARY
Daniel and participants discuss embodied skillful performance, exploring action, intersubjectivity, and active inference in a live stream session on June 15, 2021.

# IDEAS:
- Active inference incorporates both perception and action in understanding human behavior and skillful performance.
- The distinction between instructionism and interactionism is crucial for understanding skillful performance in social contexts.
- Exploring how groups embody skillful performance offers insight into collective dynamics beyond individual actions.
- Proprioception plays an anticipatory role in action selection, contributing to uncertainty reduction in skillful performance.
- The brain's role in skillful performance involves both cognitive processes and embodied action, not just instruction-driven behavior.
- Understanding skillful performance requires recognizing the dynamic interplay between cognitive processes and bodily actions.
- Effective learning environments should foster interaction and engagement rather than rely solely on instructionist approaches.
- The model of active inference can be generalized to various systems, including non-human organisms and robots.
- Skillful performance often involves balancing technical proficiency with ease and spontaneity, especially in arts and sports.
- The process of learning should prioritize reducing uncertainty rather than maximizing reward in skillful actions.
- Group dynamics can influence individual performance, particularly in sports and collaborative activities.
- Active inference challenges traditional views of cognitive processes by emphasizing the role of embodied action.
- The integration of sensory and motor functions provides a richer framework for understanding human behavior.
- The concept of a "functional profile" could help bridge the gap between different models of learning and performance.
- Performance coaching should focus on nurturing interactions rather than merely providing instructions to learners.
- Interactionism allows for a more holistic understanding of performance that includes emotional and social dimensions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Skillful performance emerges from the interplay between cognitive and embodied processes in dynamic environments.
- Interactionism enriches our understanding of how social dynamics shape individual actions and skill development.
- Uncertainty reduction through action is central to effective learning and skill acquisition in various contexts.
- Viewing individuals as models rather than mere agents offers new insights into cognitive and behavioral interactions.
- The relationship between instruction and interaction is complex, requiring a nuanced approach to learning and teaching.
- Emphasizing the anticipatory nature of proprioception enhances our understanding of embodied skillful performance.
- The generative models used in active inference can be applied to various domains beyond human behavior.
- Effective coaching should balance expertise in content with an understanding of interactive processes in learning.
- Acknowledging the role of affect and emotion in skillful performance can enhance our approach to learning.
- Active inference provides a framework for understanding the dynamical relationships between individuals and their environments.
