# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Actin Flab live stream discusses embodied skillful performance, active inference, and the interplay of instructionism and interactionism.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The stream focuses on embodied skillful performance and its implications for active inference.
2. Participants introduce themselves and share their interests related to the discussion topic.
3. The conversation revolves around connecting skillful performance to social practices and group dynamics.
4. Instructionism and interactionism are contrasted regarding their roles in understanding performance.
5. Active inference offers a broader framework for understanding sensory-motor engagement beyond optimal control theory.
6. The importance of probabilistic reasoning in reducing uncertainty and guiding action selection is emphasized.
7. The dialogue explores how proprioception functions as an anticipatory mechanism in motor control.
8. The role of affect and social dynamics in skillful performance is discussed.
9. The potential applications of interactionism in education and team collaboration are highlighted.
10. Future discussions will explore empirical evaluations of active inference and its implications across various fields.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Embodied skillful performance integrates cognitive, social, and physical dimensions.
2. Active inference provides a comprehensive framework that transcends traditional instructionist models.
3. Understanding uncertainty is crucial for effective action selection and performance.
4. Proprioception plays an active role in anticipating movements and actions.
5. Emphasizing interactionism can enhance educational practices and collaborative efforts.
