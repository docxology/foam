# IDEAS

- Active Inference Lab hosts participatory discussions on embodied skillful performance and active inference.
- Participants are encouraged to share thoughts and questions during live streams for collaborative learning.
- The discussion focuses on connecting motor skills with social practices and intersubjectivity in small groups.
- Skillful performance is examined through both individual and group dynamics in various contexts.
- Instructionism is contrasted with interactionism in understanding skillful performance and social dynamics.
- The relationship between cognitive processes and bodily actions is explored in the context of skill.
- The discussion includes the brain's role in skillful performance, particularly focusing on different brain regions.
- Understanding skill requires both cognitive and embodied perspectives, emphasizing the interplay between them.
- The paper critiques traditional motor control theories and suggests a shift towards active inference frameworks.
- Active inference integrates sensory and motor functions, providing a more holistic understanding of skilled action.
- The distinction between optimal control theory and active inference emphasizes the importance of uncertainty reduction.
- The role of value in action selection is re-evaluated, moving beyond scalar representations.
- Proprioception is highlighted as a key aspect of anticipatory action and skillful performance.
- The discussion raises questions about how to integrate interactionism into educational and coaching practices.
- The importance of understanding dynamical systems in modeling human behavior and performance is emphasized.
- The interplay between individual agency and environmental interactions is crucial in active inference frameworks.
- The challenge of transitioning from instructional models to interaction-based models in teaching is acknowledged.
- The need for a broader understanding of performance that includes emotional and social dynamics is proposed.
- The role of curiosity and exploration in skill acquisition and performance is emphasized in active inference.
- Active inference offers a framework for understanding complex interactions in various biological and social systems.
- Future discussions will explore empirical evaluations of active inference in real-world applications and settings.
