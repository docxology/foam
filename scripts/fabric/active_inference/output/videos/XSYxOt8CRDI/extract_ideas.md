# IDEAS

- The concept of self-developmental bioelectricity driving multicellularity is central to the discussion.
- The interplay between morphology and electricity raises questions about agency and goal-directedness in cells.
- Multiple nested scales of individuality exist, with each level acting as an individual agent.
- Individual cells can pursue their own goals within larger systems, affecting overall agency.
- Information flow across different levels of individuality can influence developmental processes.
- The evolution of multicellular organisms benefits from competencies of lower-level systems.
- The conservation of individuality is not fixed; it can change over time and context.
- Bioelectric signals serve as a computational medium that integrates information across biological systems.
- Understanding how bioelectricity influences development could provide insights into regenerative medicine.
- The relationship between agency and information processing in biological systems is complex and dynamic.
- The concept of modularity in gene networks allows for flexibility in evolutionary adaptations.
- Active inference models can be applied to understand decision-making in biological organisms.
- The intersection of evolution and development creates a unique landscape for studying biological agency.
- Collective intelligence can emerge from the interactions of individual agents within a system.
- Ethical considerations arise when creating synthetic life forms or modifying existing organisms.
- The distinction between living and non-living entities may not be as clear-cut as traditionally thought.
- There is a need for new ethical frameworks to navigate the complexities of synthetic biology and bioengineering.
- The nature of consciousness and agency may exist on a continuum, rather than as binary categories.
- The capacity for agency in systems can vary based on their organizational structure and interactions.
- The exploration of cognitive spaces can reveal how different agents navigate their environments.
- Future research should focus on how to measure and define agency across various biological and synthetic systems.
