# SUMMARY
Mike Levin discusses his paper on bioelectricity, multicellularity, and cognitive agency, exploring the complexities of individuality and emergent systems with participants.

# IDEAS:
- Bioelectricity serves as a computational medium for binding lower levels into higher-level cognition.
- Higher-level systems can pursue goals that don’t necessarily dictate lower-level systems’ goals.
- Individual cells exhibit agency on a continuum, influencing their collective behavior and goals.
- The connection between bioelectricity and morphogenesis highlights the interplay of electricity and morphology.
- A higher-level system's goal can overshadow the pursuits of lower-level systems.
- Evolutionary processes can be influenced by the competencies of lower-level systems.
- Competent subunits allow larger systems to work in lower-dimensional spaces, simplifying problem-solving.
- Systems can adapt to physiological stressors without prior evolutionary history.
- The relationship between action spaces and goal-directed behaviors is complex and dynamic.
- Emergent properties of collectives can result in novel functions and behaviors.
- Agency can be conceptualized as a continuum rather than a binary state.
- The cognitive horizon of an organism influences its goal-directed behaviors and strategies.
- The interplay of agency across nested systems shapes evolutionary dynamics.
- The integration of different cognitive levels facilitates problem-solving in complex environments.
- Understanding individuality requires a multi-scale perspective, considering both biological and artificial systems.
- The ethical implications of creating new forms of life necessitate a reevaluation of moral frameworks.

# INSIGHTS:
- Agency exists on a continuum, influencing behavior across nested biological systems and their interactions.
- The ethical considerations in creating synthetic life forms require new frameworks beyond traditional views.
- Bioelectricity plays a crucial role in enabling emergent cognitive functions in multicellular organisms.
- Collective intelligence arises from the interconnectedness of individual agents pursuing varied goals.
- Evolutionary dynamics can be accelerated by the competencies of individual cells within a system.
- Agency is not limited to biological entities; it can emerge in synthetic systems as well.
- The notion of individuality must account for emergent properties in complex systems.
- Understanding cognition requires acknowledging the diverse spaces in which organisms operate and interact.
- The relationship between structure and function in biology is not linear but highly interdependent.
- Non-binary distinctions in agency challenge traditional views of life and ethics.
