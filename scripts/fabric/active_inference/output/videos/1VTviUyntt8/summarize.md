# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The active inference lab discusses the significance of Markov blankets in philosophy and cognition, emphasizing their implications in active inference.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference lab hosts discussions on applied active inference concepts.
2. The paper "The Emperor's New Markov Blankets" is the focus of upcoming discussions.
3. Markov blankets connect statistical concepts to debates in philosophy and cognition.
4. Distinction made between instrumental Pearl blankets and realist Friston blankets.
5. Free energy principle (FEP) integrates machine learning and physics for self-organizing systems.
6. Active inference minimizes free energy while incorporating action and inference simultaneously.
7. Bayesian networks help model complex relationships among variables in systems.
8. Reification of Markov blankets can lead to conflation in literature.
9. The relationship between action and inference is crucial for cognitive science.
10. Inference with a model is distinct from inference within a model, impacting interpretations.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding Markov blankets is vital for grasping concepts in philosophy and cognition.
2. Active inference combines action and inference, enhancing models of cognition.
3. Distinctions between different types of Markov blankets clarify their roles in research.
4. The implications of modeling approaches affect interpretations in cognitive science.
5. Future discussions will further explore the nuances of active inference and its applications.
