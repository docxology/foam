# IDEAS

- Active Inference Lab is a participatory online platform for practicing and discussing active inference.
- The stream aims to contextualize upcoming discussions on the paper "The Emperor's New Markov Blankets."
- The paper discusses the historical development and significance of the Markov blanket in philosophy and cognition.
- The authors aim to explain the transition of Markov blankets into metaphysical discussions about consciousness and emotion.
- The paper proposes distinguishing between instrumental Pearl blankets and realist Fristen blankets in the literature.
- The distinction aims to clarify philosophical implications of the free energy principle and active inference.
- Bayesian inference is central to understanding the Markov blanket and its applications in various fields.
- Variational inference is introduced as a method to handle complex statistical models and update hypotheses.
- The free energy principle serves as a normative framework for understanding self-organizing systems.
- The paper highlights the importance of distinguishing between statistical and metaphysical interpretations of Markov blankets.
- The authors critique the conflation of different types of boundaries in literature surrounding Markov blankets.
- The use of Bayesian networks facilitates understanding complex relationships among variables in statistical models.
- Pearl blankets provide a statistical framework, while Fristen blankets introduce metaphysical claims.
- The authors emphasize the need for clarity when discussing philosophical implications in active inference and cognition.
- The relationship between action and inference is crucial for understanding living systems and modeling them accurately.
- The discussion raises questions about the appropriateness of using Bayesian networks and Markov blankets for philosophical claims.
- Active inference incorporates both sensory and active states, differentiating from classical statistical models.
- The paper encourages rigorous examination of the assumptions underlying the use of Markov blankets in research.
- The authors propose that instrumentally applying the free energy principle may avoid metaphysical commitments.
- The distinction between inference with and within a model is critical for philosophical discussions in cognitive science.
- The closing remarks suggest that simulations can model emergent processes but may not support metaphysical claims.
