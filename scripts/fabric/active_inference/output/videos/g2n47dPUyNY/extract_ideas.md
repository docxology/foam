# IDEAS

- Active inference live stream aims to explore online team communication and learning.
- Feedback from listeners is encouraged to improve future discussions and presentations.
- The next stream will focus on the paper by Ramstead et al. from 2019.
- Key topics include top-down and bottom-up causation in multi-level systems.
- Internal versus external cognition is a central theme in the upcoming discussion.
- Systems modeling and action will be examined, including philosophical perspectives.
- The paper emphasizes multi-scale integration in cognitive systems.
- Ramstead's work proposes that cognitive boundaries are nested and complex.
- The historical context of active inference connects to various philosophical ideas.
- The importance of contextualizing ideas for better understanding is highlighted.
- Upward causation suggests smaller systems influence larger ones, challenging traditional models.
- Top-down causation plays a crucial role in regulating systems and preventing dissipation.
- Multi-scale systems research needs to address both internal and external factors.
- Causal modeling is essential in understanding interactions between internal and external states.
- Optimal foraging theory illustrates decision-making based on costs and benefits in animal behavior.
- Active inference focuses on how organisms act to resolve uncertainty in their environments.
- The Markov blanket concept separates internal states from external influences in cognitive models.
- Partitioning nature versus nurture exemplifies internalism and externalism debates in genetics and cognition.
- Emergent properties arise from interactions at different system levels, revealing complex behaviors.
- Reductionism and holism represent contrasting approaches to understanding systems in science.
- Active inference may reshape perspectives on traditional philosophical dichotomies in science.
- Methodological and ontological pluralism are essential for studying complex systems effectively.
- The relationship between action and ideas must be explored within the active inference framework.
- The philosophy of science can inform the understanding of active inference and free energy principles.
- Multi-scale integration requires consideration of spatial and temporal scales in cognitive modeling.
- The importance of context and user-specific needs in mapping systems and causal relationships.
- The interplay of ideas, emotions, and desires within the active inference process is significant.
- Future discussions will aim to bridge classical philosophy of science with active inference concepts.
