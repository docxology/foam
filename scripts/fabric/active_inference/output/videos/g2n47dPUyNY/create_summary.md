2. The discussion aims to contextualize the paper by Ramstead et al. (2019).
3. Key topics include multi-level systems and causal modeling.
4. The internalism versus externalism debate is crucial for understanding cognition.
5. Multi-scale integration links different spatial and temporal scales in cognition.
6. Causal modeling helps interpret interactions between internal and external states.
7. The Markov blanket concept is essential in understanding active inference processes.
8. Active inference emphasizes the cyclical relationship between action and perception.
9. Methodological and ontological pluralism are important in studying complex systems.
10. Feedback from participants is encouraged to improve future discussions.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding active inference requires exploring its philosophical implications and historical context.
2. Multi-scale integration is essential for linking various levels of cognition and systems.
3. Causal modeling is vital for comprehending interactions between internal and external states.
4. Active inference frames behavior as a cycle of action and perception to resolve uncertainty.
5. Engaging with diverse perspectives enhances the study of complex cognitive systems.
