# SUMMARY
Acton-Flab livestream 41.2 discusses extended active inference with researchers Daniel, Dean, and Blue, focusing on trust, cognition, and technology's role in human interaction.

# IDEAS:
- Active inference allows for a framework of perception, action, and cognition to interact.
- Trust is essential in human-machine interactions and can be modeled mathematically.
- Group sensations can amplify feelings experienced collectively during events like concerts or disasters.
- The dynamics of technology adoption have varying empowerment effects on individuals.
- Extended active inference models consider both agent and environment as active participants.
- A hierarchical structure can limit understanding of complex cognitive processes and relationships.
- Cognitive processes operate within dynamic environments and can change based on context.
- The nuances of action perception can shift based on individual and collective experiences.
- Gamification influences learning and engagement but may distort intrinsic motivations and values.
- Understanding agency requires examining the interplay between individual actions and environmental context.
- Cognitive uploading can be affected by the structure of technological interfaces and user experiences.
- There is a difference between optimizing for specific goals and fostering broader engagement.
- Extended active inference emphasizes the importance of collaboration and shared cognitive processes.
- Exploring the concept of trust can reveal insights about human and technological relationships.
- The adaptive nature of technology can reshape our cognitive processes over time.
- Balancing epistemic and pragmatic values can create more meaningful interactions with technology.

# INSIGHTS:
- Trust and glue are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of extended active inference.
- Collective experiences can enhance individual sensations, creating new layers of understanding.
- Empowerment through technology adoption can shift based on the context of use.
- The interplay between different cognitive processes informs how we perceive and act in the world.
- Gamification can detract from meaningful engagement by prioritizing competition over collaboration.
- The modeling of cognitive processes must account for both individual agency and environmental influence.
- Extended active inference frameworks highlight the importance of relational dynamics in cognition.
- Adaptive technologies necessitate a reevaluation of how we approach learning and decision-making.
- The environment serves as a crucial element in shaping cognitive processes and actions.
- Understanding the implications of active inference can lead to more effective collaborative practices.
