thank you hello and welcome it's March 23 2023 and we're here in active live stream 53.1 welcome to the active inference Institute we're a participatory online Institute that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference this is a recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams head over to activeinference.org to learn more about the Institute and learning groups and projects we're here in academstream 53.1 and we are discussing a dyad of papers we are discussing snakes and ladders in paleoanthropology by Hector Carl and Michael welcome Carl and we're discussing to copy or not to copy with Hector and Michael previously in 53.0 we Dean and I provided some background and context on these papers and today in 53.1 first we will all say hello then we will feature a presentation by Michael Walker and following the presentation we'll have a discussion and see where it goes so with no further Ado we will all say hello to the non-authors first then the authors concluding with Michael and leading into the presentation so I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and it was a great fun and learning experience to work on the dot zero so I'm really excited to continue in the dot one today to Dean thanks Daniel I'm Dean I'm here in Calgary um I guess the only thing I want to just highlight today is the fact that it's a 32323 and I I I love that bouncing back and forth between those uh those two quantities so I'm really excited and I will pass this to Hector okay hello I'm Hector manrique and I will just summarize with bromy here basically I graduated in Psychology that was in Spain and then I did my PhD in psychobiology so I came to learn the biological basis of behavior um then I recycled into a comparative psychology when I joined the max plan Institute of for evolution and anthropology in Leipzig I was lucky that I could work with Joseph Kai and that his supervision and then I had the opportunity to work with the four species of great apes and after that I I came to know Michael in a confidence on human evolution and we have been working together ever since we are now good friends and also colleagues and that's it basically thank you Hector and Carl if you'd like to say hello please so my name is Carl fiston I'm a professor of neuroscience at University College London um and a colleague of our sort of main speakers today but I've never seen in person uh but now at least I have seen you uh virtually they're very nice to meet you great thank you Carl Michael the floor is yours I'm very pleased you'll say hello to Carl uh whom I've not yet met personally but we're now meeting visually virtually um I'm a retired professor at University of Washington in Spain I'm getting live ancient I should be 82 years out tomorrow but anyway that doesn't stop me if I'm digging up Neanderthal skeletons and even earlier things here in Spain um I'm very pleased to be presenting this it's a case of the dog that didn't bark in the night so um whenever you want me to begin I Can Begin Daniel yes the uh slide is up and it is all you well this is really a paper which we have out on sign archive in the version in an earlier version it's now been modified for a different journal to the one that was originally intended but the presentation is in order to make a complicated uh subject fairly simple to comprehend I call it Snakes and Ladders because stuff appears to disappears and reappears throughout human evolution over the past at least two million years if not before and the question is why is there not a continuous trajectory let's move on to the next one Daniel right the traditional view is the received wisdom is looking at anthropology can tell us from the outside and there are two basic methodologies one based on geology and Darwinism which gives us one view of what it is all about and another view down on the bottom right is all based on what modern people do and what modern Apes do and it's all by so-called analogy let's move on to the next one both of these have drawbacks uh I won't go into this in detail you're welcome to take these slides away provided you don't publish them because they do include some materials on from other sources which I haven't um acknowledged formally but the drawbacks to the to Darwinism is really the difficulty of being able to uh prove anything in the past by in its own terms um okay we can accept it as being a valid way of explaining natural phenomena and evolution the drawback to using modern analogies is the spatio temporal incumblensivability in commensurability with regard to the regular irregularities and irregular regularities of which things appear disappear and reappear throughout the pleistocene record and indeed prehistory in general let's move on to the next one so instead of looking at it from the outside let's look at it from the inside and this has an advantage of commensurability uh and compatibility at the same time with the gradual evolution of and within species by natural selection and at the same time with the documented behavior of arganus hormone uh well this is from uh cars and his colleagues latest book I'm sure you all know it so let's move on to the next one right uh in the 1960s some archaeologists were certainly reflecting including some Cambridge fans of mine on the ostensive presence of irregular regularities and regular irregularities in the archaeological record and a well-known one is the case of the wheel wheels uh we use for Traction in um Central Asia and the Middle East for about 5 000 years ago they were invented separately in mesoamerica of just over 2 000 years ago they weren't used for any kind of practical purpose but just for moving Effigies statues and toys around and this season has been completely independent inventions Okay so let's say that surprising enactment with stuff was the exception in uh early humans let's see if I can getting a little bit tied up with two screens I'm working on my own screen at the same time uh cognitive surprises were probably disregarded in general because surprising spontaneous and excellent with stuff distracted attention away from daily routines if we go back two million years ago when Homer first appears from the earlier um bipedal humans or human ancestors we begin to see the establishment of the Guinness Homer especially in Africa and I'm sure that spontaneous enactment is stuff certainly occurred innumerable times without gaining any Foothills as technological or cultural if you like communal behavioral Traditions passed down to generation and Innovation because this is unlikely if we take a period let's say from two million years ago even to an even to half a million years ago that's one and a half million years that's 60 000 generations of you consider one generation as lasting 25 years it's most unlikely that things could be handed down from father to son over sixty thousand Generations so let's take a different take on this let's go back to look at it from the inside upon considerations of the free energy principle and active influence it follows an actual inference underpins biological behavior that has exploratory or epistemic and exploitative or pragmatic aspects sensitive respectively to ambiguity and risk enabling epistemic and ambiguity resolving responses to support pragmatic reward seeking ones and therefore it is not implausible that the snakes and ladders appearance disappearance and reappearance of stuff over let's say the past two million years of the existence of organist oh to know more than the extreme Rarity with which unorthodox epistemic exploration of possibly advantageous opportunities resulted from incipient albeit and perceptibly evolving neurobiological propensities uh in brains or hierarchical mechanistic Minds to generate exploitative pragmatic attention by our active infants to cognitive surprises from and towards behavioral incidents which once expressed more on to the next one so let's forget about it let's move on to the next one Daniel let's forget about this uh how do I get from here to there how do I get more Olympic lock to that's their hand ax but spontaneously what could provoke this okay let's move on next slide I excavated the size I am Excavating the size almost a million years old which has one hand ax remains of burning lots of small stone tools so you can see some burnt ones on the bottom left but then this is the dog that didn't bark why are there no more handouts why do we only have one big Lodge by facial shape that's cutting into all the hand X and hundreds of tiny little tools people don't ask that question let's move on to the next one the explain it away boom people really didn't bother with cutting up big animals they didn't need big cutting tools well that's one way of looking at it prove it people lost stuff and so there should be more of these around but there's only one well prove that there's only one because people took them away and use them elsewhere move that the problem is this these so-called interpretations only explain stuff away could well have been a Valentine gift or not next slide so let's get back to Snakes and Ladders we have fire at the site there aren't too many sites with fire either and again uh the general assumption is that there was continuity uh once yeah trouble with moving my other um my other screen how can I move this on excuse me a moment uh my eyesight isn't all that good these days nope that's not doing it no doubt excuse me one minute um so we have the the file as I just mentioned and I don't believe that suddenly fire was brought to humans or invented and then passed on from father to son nor do I believe as we'll see in the next slide that this was done along with an expansion okay we'll have the next one down here please um of these early Homo erectus moving from Africa and outwards carrying a hand ax carrying little Embers and spreading the good news no next slide don't think it worked like that stuff couldn't have been passed on overall that period of time over all that space this is not commensurable with modern human or modern ape Behavior let's move on to the next one Daniel so how do we begin We Begin by bashing Stone in excellent with stuff and that started over three million years ago we know that next one please and then we have another problem which is that there is almost exponential increase in stock artifacts made by people and yet the brain as we know from fossil evidence does not follow that trajectory which is the red one the brain increases and gradually flattens out at the same time as the number of stuff that people make increases or almost exponentially let's have the next one so here we have another problem to try and solve and one possibility which was pointed out by the late professor Philip Tobias uh is that as the brain increases we see in the paleontal paleoanthological they called an increase in the variation in the volume of the brain suggesting perhaps that there is some relaxation of selection pressure as homo uh evolved and we have the next that's a point which is worth bearing in mind so let's think about another way of how all this male men of them happened a methodological perspective grounded in fundamental biological and physical relationships gives us a parsimonious Mosaic deflationary account all these appearances disappearances and reappearances of Behavioral outcomes and so-called skills now Professor Nicholas steenbergen who was a professor of zoology at Oxford and got a Nobel Prize was fascinated with four questions let's have the next slide and see what those are you want to know how we can relate Evolution at four different levels that of ontogeny and that of the mechanisms the causation that's a phylogeny and that of adaptation or survival value and these are related uh sent via chronically and synchronically as one can see from this little diagram into also what might call proximate and ultimate explanatory um uh approaches if we look at the problem in hand let's have the next slide Daniel um we can see that here we have in the diacronic aspects Paleolithic behavior in general in the synchronic one stuff appearing at different times in the top right as far as ontogeny is concerned we have something which I'll mention later on but we need to make a big deal of it that we know that there was a lack of adolescent Growth work and a relatively uh um small brain in homoelect just one and a half million years ago compared with ours it's about two-thirds of the side of ours when we think of mechanisms here we come to look at it from the inside we have a matter of awareness involving active influence the three energy principle and variation of the energy and we have what happens at the neurophysiological level uh allowing a complexity of behavior between hand and and stuff and and so in this case or stones we have to involve matters such as working memory long-term memory perspective memory and indeed um constructive memory so how does all this time to phylogen here we have a Snakes and Ladder model based on the empirical evidence from the past and we have survival value that clearly existed because homologous eventually gave rise to us next slide please so let's get back to Snakes and Ladders here we have looking at lock and saying how the hell do I get this hand accomplish and now the next one and in the same way with the next slide we have the snakes and ladders a game of protons and a random outcomes but but but next slide please we are not dealing with completely random outcomes there's a big difference between on the one hand the spatio temple snakes and that is game of chance as if those of a dice alone brought about appearance of disappearances in their appearances by group phenomena unrelated to responses of the hierarchical mechanistic minds of early homo and on the other hand a hey snakes and that is analogy but regular irregularities and irregular regularities in the behavioral record owing to individual idiosyncratical and Orthodox activity and the receptivity to it or not of an observing hierarchical mechanistic mind whether it's for non-lookup a bystander or that even the South same man making the woman making the handbags okay let's move on to the next one and here we begin to see that the heterogeneous composition of a picture of appearances by chance alone disciplines is by chance of their reappearances by chance alone then is it useless as a model for making predictions that can be compared or contrasted with archaeological signings of early paralytic science whereas our preferred model by focusing on the information theoretic and energetic constraints on biological neurobiological and psychosocial Evolution affords as a picture that lets us consider whether the model's Focus could offer a rational interpretation of the material black Ward and the zika of the uneven distribution across the old world things like stone hand access and evidence of the tending of fire or even visiting caves things that chimpanzees and gorillas don't do between 2 million and let's say 200 000 years ago in this case 80 000 Generations okay let's move on very quickly and the rest of it in fact you're welcome to uh read for yourselves rather than have me read it out to you because basically um you can take this away or copy it or download it what we are now arguing is that about a million years ago adaptive Evolution was underware of cerebral human neurobiological propensities that support prospective and constructive memory in making artifacts or working with stuff doing unusual unorthodox themes together with short-term working memory including that of the hands haptic working memory long-term working memory and long-term procedural and episodic memory there's propensities will find out genetic outcomes of existential ontogenetic programs adapted to the natural selection for satisfying the bioenergetic requirements of organisms our get us in particular so here we have the basis of our arguments it is a small band of communicatively challenged Homo erectus one member spontaneous enactment often was went unregarded disregarded because regarded as useless pointless and unhelpful to Gathering the food requirements needed to surviving from day to day and we can refer the matter to the three energy principle applied to ecological nicheconstruction variation on your orthology to use Professor efficient phrase whereby selection of adaptive actions organisms involves their assessment of their Alternatives in terms of the expected variation of three energy expresses the combination of epistemic and pragmatic affordances so these early individuals a million and a half years ago who experienced cognitive surprises that's to say prediction errors about effective uh variational theology were unlikely to introduce novel behaviors whether affected or seen by them they could gain a foothold in their Community before those communicative skills have developed in some groups that widened their social scope for active influence and involved by natural selection within a shared framework of adapted prayer beliefs favoring alignment of common expectations and Joint activities that affected their ecological niche well that's the basis of our argument of course it's no more as it were fortified law or the future or within the terms of the data from the past than the Alternatives that I began with but at least it makes rational coherent sense and fits in with the uh darwinist view of the evolution of species and within species by natural selection it is a more prosaic and deflation rate argument than the ones that people archaeologists and anthropologists like to use and which I began with so you can take this away and read it and read it carefully what we're arguing is about a million years ago uh sorry can you move on Daniel and again so let's just uh stick with this um I think we can I think we can go through this rather quickly move on to the next one uh uh yes sir right let's go let's go back to a million and a half years ago let's look at the stuff we know there's a skeleton about only nine years old according to uh Professor Christopher the dean of University College uh professor of dental anatomy and he studied the teeth and whilst at one time uh this individual had the same height as myself I'm about um I'm all the short one meter 57 um nevertheless although he had our adult size he only he was only a child at nine years old and his skull had almost certainly stopped going it was only two-thirds or less than the size of ours but he was these people were clearly making hand axes and lighting fires or at least carrying file around it from time to time and visiting caves we know there was one in South Africa bomber cave and doing stuff that is sort of halfway between what a chimp does and what our modern primitive peoples are supposed to have been able to do let's say ten thousand or twenty thousand years ago during the last ice age but there's a big time difference here and when we think about this kid clearly he was developing much sooner than we do he became an adult probably before the age of 15 years old whereas our brains are not fully formed for at least another 10 years so this would have limited let's have the next slide um uh you can take these away and look at that I don't I don't have to read all this out in detail to you but in uh in short um these people were precociously developed and therefore much more limited they would be behaving perhaps more like let's say um a modern I don't know four or five-year-old child of modern adult height and with a small brain well they're not doing too badly if they kept uh making uh things making stuff uh with their hands doing things and then forgetting about them because their main purpose was to survive and they had to eat and find something to eat and they couldn't spend all their time in these rather than productive activities so let's say that um let's take the active influence approach to this and suggest that from a perspective of the free energy principle and active influence the differences uh that we're seeing contextualize The Experience dependent learning and planning and influence on a small scale but they reflect the structural and neurobiological priors that could be inherited by epigenetic and genetic processes within the hierarchically mechanistic minds that were evolving and which certainly were not the same as those of modern chimpanzees and guerrillas that don't do all these things that even are Homo ancestors were doing one and a half million years ago well Okay I accept that the absence of evidence need not imply the evidence of their absence but that fails to satisfy most people or many people particularly scientists like ourselves certainly uh the Darwin's argument had Powerhouse power but if we take a look at early human evolution from the perspective of the free energy principle our proposal invokes an overarching methodological Paradigm grounded in an existential principle fundamental to the evolution of living organisms and is consistent both with the long periods of time and the vast periods of space in the old world that we are dealing with let's say 60 000 or even 80 000 Generations across three continents and nevertheless uh explain allows us to interpret from the point of view of natural selection what was going on albeit imperceptibly slowly by natural selection and adaptation at least some of the irregular regularities and regular irregularities or phenomena attributable to Romeo in the pleistocene record reflect the kinds of claws of the anomalous behavioral outcomes that doubtless occurred often in the snakes and ladders model of evolution in early members of organis regardless of what species we want to call their skeletal remains whether neanderthals or the lectures modern homo whatever okay these are plausible uh outcomes of behavior by individuals who fail to maintain Orthodox behavioral responses when faced with cognitive supplies and people showed almost certainly particularly in neurobiological propensity to exploring unorthodox possibilities a propensity that's involved further in humans and in great apes which are leak and like even our very young children seem unable to envisage how things might be as well as how they actually are as the Canadian psychologists and primatologist Professor Ann Rustin has written and with that I will end my little introduction which I hope will explain of all the complicated approach to producing a novel interpretation of uh how human behavior was evolving during a very long period of time and across a very large period of space on our planet during the pleistocene thank you thank you Michael yes that is the end of the presentation great thank you for the presentation we will now move into discussion so I'm gonna open up a blank page and then Hector Carl and Dean please feel free to join Dean first I want to just first of all Michael I don't know I'm not sure what your stature is in person but after that presentation you're a giant in my mind so and that's that's not said out of out of me needing to compliment you and I think that thank you for the presentation I'm curious now because the approach that Daniel and I took was one of trying to parameterize a space between the two papers I'm curious now what Hector thinks in terms of sort of holding up that other that other side of this set in particular with the paper on to copy or not to copy and uh we might Now sort of gain some depth perception around things like zonu about its surprisal now that we've had sort of the introduction with the presentation that Michael just shared foreign feel free to give a first comment okay so you want me to comment on to copy or not to copy on this one or how they exactly yeah the Zone amount is surprises in particular but yeah sort of the groundwork that Michael has just established okay perfect I would like to start by thanking uh both uh Michael and Carl for uh I mean this collaboration because I think I was thinking in the aphorism by Newton while activity to Newton is not original from him of on the shoulder of Giants and and I think I feel like here I'm on this huge intellect and and I feel very privileged too so I want to thank them both and Carl especially because he has been so kind as to revise our two papers I mean in one he's author but in the other he revised it and give us very good uh indications and advice to him very grateful because we all know how busy he is so it took the time to help us and I'm very grateful and coming back to the the papers the thing is that Michael came up with this original idea of explaining this appearance and disappearance of hand access in terms of the free energy principle um and when we were working on that paper I thought that the same argument could apply naturally to the case of gray Daves and the thing that there was this personally in grade 8's um studies when they study this kind of social transmission or culture or commodative culture cumulative technology and what's happened is that there are many reports on chimpanzees being innovative meaning Innovative like they invent new things new behaviors or new exploitation Resources by applying new tools so there are many instances of this but there is a puzzle here as there is the other puzzle with appearance and disappearances of technology that there is no cumulative technology so this is a puzzle for me because if you have one creature who is able to be so inventive how is it possible that it doesn't accumulate complexity in the technology so the same cognitive machineries so to speak should be able to produce more complex artifacts so there is no kind of accumulation of complexity across Generations and that's a big puzzle for me so I thought maybe the free energy principle was useful here too so I just made this analogy so it's Michael who opened up this new Avenue thanks to the work of of Carl and I just took advantage to seeing maybe it is because new things are too surprising for Great Waves so there are creatures that cannot cope with high levels of surprise and I mean if I'm talking too farther to Manchester me I think you are following the argument I assume is it okay so the idea is that if something that I observe is too surprising I have to deal with this high level of surprise and also by reading a paper by Andy Clark was the title was politic coding it was in behave a behavior and brain Sciences if I remember correctly he thought of one can see very surprising things if he's able to credit the sensual information as opposed to the top down prediction and this again helped me to make the connection so maybe the problem is that from the point of view of the server of an innovation if something is too surprising I have to consider if I trust the central information as opposed to the the top-down prediction and this kind of I need to decide I mean I'm talking I need to decide like it was some kind of animistic thing but you know what I mean so this is the Wake waiting up of central information and a top-down prediction so my idea was that perhaps what happens here is that this great apes when they observe something new and it's surprising they kind of do not credit it so it's like they basically do not register that because it's um kind of is a mismatch with the prediction and for some reason they are not able to credit the essential information and this brings us to the concept of the songs of Bandit surprises so this song is a an imaginary concept it's something we we used to explain what happened so it's like if you have a wide zone of a boundary surprisingly means that things that are not in accordance with your top-down predictions things that deviate much from these two of them predictions can be can be handled because you are able to bounce your prices so you have cognitive mechanisms that help you to bounce your presence even when you are facing huge mismatches uh uh with regard to your expectations to previous expectations so that's we the main thing here so we propose that in Gray devs there has not been these changes in the brand that allow them to bounce surprises well things deviate marketing from when the what they expect only indeed when they deviate the slightly from what they expect so they can accumulate complexity provided the things and they observe that are new are not um very different from what they expected and I think I will stop here and I can make more Precision but that is the basic idea I don't know if Michael is in agreement or he wants to accept him because I hope I have my limitation with language too so perhaps you can help me out Michael do you have something to add or to precise um not really fundamentally I accept what Hector is saying his idea was certainly novel to me when he put it forward that we have to think about The Observers not merely the practitioners because anthropologists and archaeologists and indeed many people working in the cognitive and psychological Sciences have tended to put the emphasis uh in terms of skills on the person who performs them and not the person who or not the observation of those skills which is so necessary of course and I didn't realize this until Hector pointed it out to me so necessary of course for their transmission to take hold at all and this struck me as being most important Insight uh so obvious that when wonders why one never thought of it oneself in the same way that one wonders why it is but so many failure anthropologists and archaeologists uh are more concerned with the stuff than with why the stuff isn't there um these are such obvious problems they go back to Sherlock Holmes and so Arthur Conan Doyle um but we tend to be obsessed with what we can see and feel and touch rather than um with uh what sort of process might have um led to explaining both present cells and absences at the same time and this is where I find the whole notion of active inference uh so important to tie in with uh Evolution um it was Professor person himself who enthused me to go back to the lectures that I used to attend 50 years ago when I was an undergraduate that were given by Nicholas timbergan at Oxford I would steal away from the lectures of anatomy given by someone to grow Clark to attend those of Nicholas tinbergen and other people and uh I've come to realize just how important uh lorensis and Tim Bergens and um of Portland Fish and Von Fishers um Daniel knows uh were and how worthy they were of getting 50 years ago the Nobel Prize the physiology or medicine um 50 years later we're still trying to get to terms with the significance of their insights which shows just how how difficult it is for us to absorb novelty but nevertheless um uh I'm no giant I'm a dwarf uh we stand on the shoulders of giants not only Lawrence and tinbergen and fish Darwin of course and um going back to base in the 18th century one critic of our sciatric paper said that we were that we were um promo in other words we were post-modernist no no we go back in a good scientific and purple tradition and theoretical tradition back to the 18th century nothing postmodern about us at all I think all of us would reject any suspicion that we were involved in post-processual and post-modernist arguments unlike many of our uh colleagues in what I call the Social Studies I like the late Lou Binford and archaeologists in America and some note uh I prefer social studies to social science which I think can at times is something of an oxymoron um yeah I suspect that um others will dispute that with me however um I'm no do I'm no giant I'm a dwarf it took me all my time to cope with something we were never taught at school Matrix algebra which I had to learn when I was doing my research on um previous skulls and from then to cope with bass film and the approaches or the uses that can be made of Base mathematical statistics using um using Matrix Theory which I've gradually caught up with and I can follow it but I certainly wouldn't be capable unlike Professor Christen of yeah of deriving it but I can certainly understand the significance of something that I think a lot of our colleagues in the humanities and social studies simply are not prepared to confront at all I think they prefer much more subjective if you like post-modernist thinking to rational scientific analysis well thank you what's the screen huh can you see me I can see you I can see oh we we see you Carl to um well actually I just no longer quite as good as it used to be uh so I sometimes send your huddle over the computer it's all good it's all good Carl maybe you could come in and um share how this collaboration came to be or from your view from the inside or however else you'd like to comment on what we've seen so far yes well thank you very much for the opportunity um I I I also have to do a lot of huddling because of my failing eyesight um so yeah just to reiterate your what a joy was to hear that presentation and Hector's follow-up um so this is this is uh for me an adventure well outside my comfort zone so I'm here as a passenger and spectator um and learning a lot I I didn't know half of this stuff um uh you know even though I did a lot of uh biology and a little bit of evolutionary um biology as a young man but this is this is intriguing and um foundational insights into the way that we are um so I'm I'm gonna make a few comments it's gonna be more of a stream of Consciousness but I qualify this again but this is this is completely outside my comfort zone I'm just talking as a layperson here or a lay physicist perhaps um and I'll just make a few observations but I mean I've been particularly interested in your synthesis because of course you have a probably more than any of us the broader oversight from The evolutionary perspective right through to the the Bayesian mechanics that um is entailed by things like active inference so um I I just to forewarn you I'm going to call upon you to to do this do the synthesis and to draw and and join the dots that haven't already been joined although there's been a lot of dot joining um from what I can see already um so the stream of Consciousness um comes really from um this um commitment to ideas that are certainly not postmodern I think I'd probably have to go back to Plato um and certainly sort of uh get stuck around the the ear of helmholtz and the like uh you know from from the um from the physicists uh point of view um and assuming that looking at the looking at the this sort of remarkable uh Snakes and Ladders phenomenon from Through The Eyes of a physicist and it certainly makes um complete sense that if we're looking at a uh a process that would be described as a non-equilibrium steady state that is slowly evolving um that could be if you like a mathematical image of The evolutionary process the definitive feature of these non-equilibrium steady States that have um um the your biological aspect is that they entail a revisiting of the trajectory to neighborhoods of certain parts of face space so if I read face spaces basically the state of evolution or what what phenotypes are doing or what is encoded genetically in a very very crude broad level there can be no other solution to a particular trajectory that is up for describing a non-equilibrium steady state than the occasional ion Tyrant recurrence of certain states of being literally being close um or revisiting neighborhoods of uh certain um regimes of Faith space um so the snakes and ladders um image seems to me a very apt image to actually describe all back attractors which are another way of articulating these kinds of Dynamics or this kind of kind of Dynamics in the sense that they have this aspect of recurrence and they have this aspect of self-contained itinerancy which are the Hallmarks of any system really that exists over a substantial period of time um only you know it would be interesting to think can it be any other way and I would submit no you know if you have um a a physical process this is unfolding at multiple time scales and and it is endowed and can be recognized either historically or in the Moment by by being in certain characteristic States and literally uh characterize the system in question so that it can be named um you know whether it's a species or whether it's your behavior or whether it's an artifact or whether it's a process um then it must be the case that it has this uh it has this kind of iteriency where things come and go so it will be interesting just to um if you're in a um as a pure exercise for pure mathematics to support things like the ponkare recurrence theorem into a snakes on ladders format um and vice versa because I think there's something fundamentally true it has to be that has to be the way that things are um and I I see that um in many fields um the um and two immediately came to mind um the first was um current Notions of the not the spread of ideas or the spread of tools but the spread of cancer you know the view that cancer um there are two views of cancer there's a sort of 20th century view that you get a one cell in your body fails to recognize that it should not be growing and just keeps on growing and you'll get these uh um Progressive and inevitable growth of the cancer um set of cells and at some point they will disseminate and see themselves around the body you get in this past the season second risk and the like and ultimately unless it's cured then it will it will destroy the phenotype there's another view which is is now becoming more prevalent which is a much more Snakes and Ladders View and this view is that um where all the time generating little cancer cells but 99.9 of the of the time they don't get a foothold so that we're in the equilibrium um or hopefully on the right side of an equilibrium always being host to little cancer cells uh it's just that it's very rarely that they actually establish themselves to us to the extent that they can um get a foothold and reproduced to actually produce a you know a tumor um or a neoplastic growth and and that that struck me it would be nice to put a snakes and ladders sort of picture on uh the way that that particular biological natural system um is viewed and it's certainly very consistent with current views on cancer the other thing um the other system um that seems to comply with this notion is not again the spread of ideas or the spread of uh tools or cultural means um that the spread of viruses in epidemiology you know it's very interesting that um that there are certain um viruses for example that get a foothold and explode exponentially and we've had you know we've just enjoyed or witnessed a um an episode of that with the with the uh the recent covid-19 pandemic but there are other um very very similar episodes that don't get a foothold and they they they die out very very quickly because they can't spread um and um I I know this personally because we were looking for data when modeling using actually exactly the same maths that underwrites the engine principle active influence we were modeling the coronavirus crisis recently and we hope to get some priors on certain parameters by looking at Legacy historical data that and it's interesting that there is data out there on very similar viral epidemics but they died out too quickly to generate enough data to make sense of um so things like MERS for example um was so recorded but it went away before it actually produced enough data to get a handle on it um so again um you know this phenomena of um sort of things repeating themselves you know you know climbing up the ladder but then sometimes uh falling down a stake very very quickly so that they you have to wait until the next occurrence seems to be a fundamental uh fundamental um aspect of um Ensemble Dynamics wherever you see it either within the body in terms of near play Zero um in terms of epidemiology and sped and I use the word spread deliberately because of the you know that that latter perspective on um basically to copy or not to copy so if if you're copying then you um then you're in the game of spelling um and if you don't copy then you don't spend so I think just coming back to you know um to the question um you know what what what is it that um determines whether a particular cognitive supplies a your a novel um approach to uh you know a way of Behaving or indeed a way of being catches on or not um and um you know that dialectic I think is you know it's absolutely intriguing I should just say the course all of this formulation rests very very sensitively on a separated temporal scales you know and um you know we have to sort of be in the background there is always this um um separation of scales that you get with with Evolution um and in this particular instance what we are talking about is really whether um certain things can survive generationally um in the spirit I would imagine of sort of Evo Devo and cultural Niche construction um and then the question then is okay at a fast time scale of your interactions between phenotypes and what's going to make that sufficiently endemic to be um propagated at a transgenerational uh time scale um I think that's a really interesting question um you know against the kind of question which uh um as a neuroscientist and same as a clinician you are often um confronted with your things for example like um epilepsy you know what is it that um constraint that determines whether a particular epileptic surprising Dynamic discharge in a particular part of the brain can be propagated and disseminated throughout the brain to give you a fit or as opposed to it sort of Auto vituating or you know quenching itself because the neighboring cells are just not interested they just don't recognize that particular pattern and it's um and and it's and it's inhibited um and I guess the answer I mean I think we've already had the answer um both Michael and Hector have articulated it but um the I guess the answer lies in the mechanics of the spread of ideas and shared frames of reference and whether it is too surprising um to be incorporated into your con specifics or your your community um or whether it is learnable um and can be um incorporated or absorbed into your generative models um such that it can then be spread to the next person you know in in the standard sense of sort of um Niche construction um and Hector mentioned specifically one key determinant of that which is the um of Robertson's Michael but it was the the ability to um change your mind um and you know the ability to change your mind is absolutely fundamental and if you just you know if you want to frame this in an active inference context um just confronted with a cognitive surprisal as it has been articulated a set of difficult to explain um Sensations or sensory evidence then there are two ways in which you can resolve that surprise the first way is to change your mind and to adjust your internal generative models or your do some amazing beliefs updating on the inside to make sense of this thing and that might depend upon some experience dependent learning over a suitable time scale um so that you're changing your model your generative model of the world to make it more apt to explain this novel observational or observation of one of your con specifics doing this kind of thing them the other thing the other way is not the um the perceptual response the belief updating on the inside to make your predictions more like the sensations it's to actually act upon the world to um to make your Sensations more like they were predicted so this is a fun this is foundational inactive influence and there's two complementary ways of minimizing surprise or or prediction error you either change your mind or you change the thing that you're surprised about um you know at every level at every temporal scale so just read in terms of whether I um I'm able to change my mind about witnessing fire there are two ways I can say yes fire is a thing and you know I can then um incorporate or imbibe that into my world and model um um become the kind of creature that actually engages with fire or I can act to put the fire out and then I don't have to worry about it both are perfectly appropriate ways of minimizing surprise and the difference at a very basic level um the um the thing that determines what I um whether I uh perceive or act or whether I engage in perceptual or active inference um in the moment to moment depends exactly on something which was um again mentioned implicitly earlier on which is the Precision afforded your the sensory evidence relative to your prior beliefs so as a physiologist um if you don't know this you know it was a beautiful there were beautiful illustrations of this so if we if you if we just forget about the notion um at the moment of sort of long-term revisions or belief updating of our generative model over multiple experiences to an instance of somebody making a fire um or providing me with a Valentine's gift of a hand ax um and just get the thing now to um the moment-to-moment ways of making uh of sampling the world and making sense of the world um it's the case that in order to move in order to change the world I have to attenuate the Precision afforded my sensory information because if I didn't do that I would not be able to ignore all the evidence that I'm not currently moving so the most beautiful example of this I think is something called circadic suppression it's when we move our eyes and we do so about four times a second we actually attenuate the Precision of the sensory evidence uh so that we are able to actually move our eyes which basically means you can't see the optic flow induced when you make a sharp or psychatic eye movement and yet 50 milliseconds after you've made the eye movement you're suddenly now attending to the visual information that you can see so you can't you can't actually see anything while your eyes are moving because you've got this sensory attenuation which is basically putting the priors um you're in charge uh suspending attention to the sensorium while you are acting um failures of that um and have quite horrible consequences so a failure to ignore the evidence that I'm not moving and the failure to attenuate or suspend attention attenuate the Precision of sensory evidence or afforded sensory evidence um looks think like things like Parkinson's disease so you know we think that um this Precision is encoded by certain neurochemical Transmissions particularly dopamine a deficit of dopamine basically means an inability to um attenuate the evidence from your um stress receptors or all these signals coming from the body and that you're not currently moving so if you have the probably believe I'm going to move I'm going to sit up walk um drink from this cup you may have that primarily but it's immediately counteracted by and dispelled by very precise evidence you're not moving so you can never actually initiate a movement and what you actually see clinically is basically a psychomota poverty or or a bradykinesia the point I'm making here all reduces to something very very simple which is the Precision afforded sensory evidence and if you can't get that right and notice it has to be estimated at every time scale either in terms of psychotic suppression on a a 10 millisecond time scale right through to um that one might actually argue um an evolutionary time scale and I make that argument because um precision is it it can also be thought of as a rate constant so if if I've got some sort of um sensory evidence and some prior beliefs um and I now view my belief updating at any level whether it's sort of you know my neural activity encoding my beliefs at the moment or whether it's my um my neuronal connectivity or um you know encoding what I have learned or what's neurodevelopment or indeed out of the evolutionary time scale the Precision can be read as a rate constant so now what we're talking about is a certain quantity that is absolutely crucial for whether I um adopt this um or incorporate um instill this novel experience into my model or not that depends upon a Precision or a rate constant which means that um one would um if one wanted to ask the question you know why do some species have the ability to um to learn uh whereas other species don't then I think the the answer is quite simply in their ability to um to optimize and adjust their learning rate either Precision afforded the evidence at hand that drives the learning um and I I'm wondering whether there are a couple of ways to take that that sort of um mathematical take on this on this really single really important quantity team and just to make it intuitive I'm trying to get back to the copy versus not copy so if I can copy that means that I am um I'm impressed impressionable what does that mean it means that I will accumulate new evidence very very quickly what does that mean that means I have the capacity to assign greater evidence to or Precision to that sensory evidence and suspend the Precision of my prior beliefs I'm not rigid in my thinking I can learn because I am impressionable um what would that look like what would look like you were young it would look like you have just been born and you are designed to learn because you you have yet to build neurodevelopmentally your model of the world um which means that um averaged over a lifetime the um the degree to which you are likely to learn and implicitly enable the spread of ideas um and you know ignite this particular lab episode of um your of a new tool or a new a new way of doing things or um being um then it would look as if you are younger for longer so I'm just I was just intrigued I think I think Michael I was making a explicit reference to the fact that um that it may be some there may be a key difference between certain species maybe the um the duration or the timing of the point where you basically switch off your learnability you switch off your uh impression ability and you become an adult and you bake in then and then from that point on you become old and wise and stuck in your ways and instead of actually trying to change your mind when something changes you don't you become non-conservative in a political sense but you actually uh try to keep things status quo commit to the social norms but before that you don't you explore you go to discos you do bungee jumping you um you know make new friends but if it's the case then that the the the spread of ideas depends upon being a child at heart for longer then then that observation about at what point do we um get to that uh epigenetically determined stage of neurodevelopment becomes absolutely crucial I'm just even longer this is the final Point um an even longer time scale I'm wondering whether the same maths can be borrowed or the same Concepts at least can be borrowed um to think about um this kind of evolvability on the perspective of people like Stuart Kaufman and like so selection for selectability so again if you're now reading these rate constants or precisions um uh in an evolutionary setting what you're what you are talking about is basically the the you know the mutation rates or the selectability um which of course itself can be subject to selective pressure so you know if you um if you commit to this style of thinking about belief updating in a in a in a mathematical sense at many different levels or different spatial temporal scales on these temporal scales um then it may be that the the selection for selectability or the selectability in and of itself is um exactly the same kind of quantity that is the your the learnability and the be you know being young at heart for longer that just is the same kind of um quantity that is uh required right down to the level of uh psychotic suppression and sensory tenuation that determines when we act to keep the world constant as opposed to no we actually have to attend to this evidence and and update our beliefs um and um if that's the case then um this notion uh well I just wanted to to close on on on sort of the importance of um cultural Niche construction um looked at um through the lens of these this um rate of um adaptation Precision selectability at different levels and how all of these couple to each other in a sort of bootstrapping way and whether that would be you're a useful view of um the spread of the spread of ideas um sometimes spelling and sometimes not spreading um can I just ask it that did we um did we or did did you laterally um sort of Leverage um sort of the well actually though this is basically setting up Daniel for his his perspective but I'm just wondering how much um people in um Evo Devo and uh evolution is psychology I'm thinking here people like Cecilia Hayes and uh cognitive gadgets how much they they think about these um these issues and whether there's the opportunity or whether they have a snakes and ladders like um view of things uh from the point of view of um evolutionary psychology and that's it that's all I have to say thank you Daniel your turd thank you wow barely no which side of that hand ax to flake um the multi-scale learning is a great point and perspective we can just imagine the extreme cases in the total acceptance of sensory evidence world then that thing defined by its revisiting potentially infrequently of characteristic states that thing ceases to be that thing in that whether that's seen in some positive um light a neutral entanglement light or a death like light it will cease to be that thing because it will have just simply informationally if not bio-materially accepted the generative processes in positions and then the other extreme case would be no attention ah See No Evil Hear No Evil and in that case the trajectory from a Bayesian mechanics perspective is massive it's a a trajectory with so much inertia that it can't be moved and that sounds like it would ever happen but in fact when we heard from Hector and Michael that like upon seeing an innovation a gray ape does not take up that Innovation there prior on how to accomplish a behavioral outcome or even at a higher order some functional outcome can be seen as massive the Bayesian physical inertia of their top down prior dominates these potentially sparse or non-linearly related cues coming up from the bottom so simply by not paying attention to the bottom-up cues there's the imposition of this top-down mass and so that's a Bayesian mechanical way to understand well if we had no priors at all no prior no problem but then we dissolve but if we have um the Titanic prior then it's a fragile strategy and so if the niche were very simple and unchanging that may be locally in adaptive strategy and on certain axes of phenotype where there can be regularities we do see those kinds of strategies like a bacterium that has selected to live in a constant temperature geothermal niche may come to entrench in its protein structure and in its gene regulatory networks and so on in embodiments that sharpens and sharpens and sharpens its capacity to compete in that regularity from a temperature perspective and therefore at the detriment of Fitness in changing environments so that's one aspect is seeing learning as this multi-scale synergetic and ongoing renegotiation process of the updating across multiple scales some spatial temporal scales of which there are no problems with talking about those using the cognitive ontology like perception cognition and action but then some scales especially Beyond the physical mechanisms that those cognitive ontological terms arose from it becomes like well what does it mean for the population to pay attention to something or what does it mean for the Niche to pay attention to something so that was one angle on the rates and it speaks to the importance of having flexible and interoperable Mathematics and statistics and Analysis Frameworks so we can just qualitatively even in conversation start to see that as a starting point instead of needing to argue up to that point of that being important for example in pursuit of transdisciplinary synthesis conceptually epistemically or so that we could explain predict design control create pragmatically how can we take that multi-scale insight as our starting points and then I think that leads to a question in the chat which I will ask now Mark frickman wrote early in the video was the complaint that there was a lack of evidence as to why certain things occurred in the archaeological evidence record how does active inference not suffer from the same issue and so it's a key question thank you Mark for asking and was the motivation for one of my underlying motivations for even reading and investigating with this lens was great if we can describe everything and we have this very interesting mathematics and so on how do we go from a technique and a method to moving beyond some limitations of previous analysis techniques with respect especially to the historical record we can go to Dean or whomever else has a thought I can I can throw something in but I'm not sure it's it's going to satisfy directly the question um maybe somebody else wants to hear something about it here I indirectly answered the question and I'll come and I'll Loop into what I think might be satisfying part of it I think one of the things that that in particular that to copy or not to copy paper emphasizes is the observer's perspective so rather than just looking at that as a as something written down on a page taking up or absorbing that position the observer's perspective I think what the two papers and and one of the things that we try to highlight in and we're so grateful that Michael and and Carl and and Hector were willing to let us look at two things at once was the idea that the papers um both raised the Specter of and I put quotes around this The Narrative follows what the implications of start with a story about seeing phenomena X actually are now one of the implications of that is that when you have a story you can't have gaps in the plot so people who are are really story biased and story forward they want those gaps filled in as quickly as possible that's how we comprehend but the interesting thing is if we are actually actively inferring as opposed to just seeing it as a subject matter or a topic we can take a game theory approach and in games there will be random gaps like Charles Sanders Pierce says an exhaustive inquiry well if it's exhaustive we're also going to need recovery and reflection and and so on so there will be gaps and so the snakes and ladders metaphor to me is like okay perfect now we're starting with a game as opposed to the retelling or the manufacturing of starting with a story so there's very different mechanisms in in the two approaches right there are there are very different assumptions in the two approaches and then the question around modeling as per as perspective swapping kind of pivots on the stuff that Michael was talking about in terms of how is the change based model depth capacity either affording or not affording that ability to play with time as opposed to being captured by it because in a story you've you've written down what the sequence is it's now been applied now you can interpret that but in terms of that actual effort of starting with the story it's now stabilized per se relatively speaking so let's start with the game and Carl's heard this before because I asked him a question about a year and a half maybe two years ago is starting with a game is a prediction matter expertise strategy or a bias starting with a story is a subject matter expertise strategy or a bias and you can understand why if you're if you're dealing with historical records to fall into a default of okay well we have to start with the story but I think what Hector and Michael are are at least asking us to have a conversation around is well so what if we do bring this other way of viewing the circumstances taking that game strategy and putting it on the same Shelf as the story strategy so again if you if you look at the assumptions around why gaps have to be filled in as opposed to there will be gaps because the game is on something as simple as that and being able to hold the two things up at once can sometimes at least tell you a little bit about maybe some of the some of these conditions that you as the Observer are inserting on what it is that you're observing or examining was it Sherlock who said the game is afoot Maybe right yeah okay yes Carl indeed uh Michael or Hector how is this Landing with with what you're thinking right now Michael go ahead you always know better then I can pick up from you I'm not quite sure where to begin um perhaps thinking in terms of the evolution of both the brain and the body in the Guinness homo uh we and possibly neanderthals also maybe from as early as three quarters of a million or even or at least half a million years ago seem to have undergone an evolution towards a bimodal growth spurt or growth curve now caused by the Adolescent growth spurt following a period period of childhood slowing down in growth which is unique in our ganus to organize and seems to be related in adolescence to some changes in terms of the agility to react to a complex situations or not as the case may be but even before that in early childhood I'm now talking about the first three or four years of life our infants seemed to have exceeded already quite considerably their cognitive ability particularly with regard to working memory when contrasted against the present great apes in other words there has definitely been not merely an expansion of the brain but in particular changes in the connective systems within the brain which clearly must have an evolutionary physical basis in terms of uh structure both endure and in particular in draw neuronal structure which when I began to study medicine physiology over a long time ago now 1960 um we could barely imagine uh it was only in the very end of the 1950s I think 59 if I'm not mistaken a very sufficient can correct me that at Cambridge Henry huxler was doing uh and uh began to do intra neural studies on on action potentials we were doing them in the lab at Oxford as undergraduates about four years later and then I was doing them under Professor power Gleason a few years later still with a practical application um because we were studying uh the change the changes in these following orthocracial phosphate poisoning which had a structural situation in hens which we were working on similar to those in humans who had suffered from a massive outbreak of poisoning at agadir in Morocco when a lot of local people were sold American jet fuel oil rich in autocracial phosphates for cooking with and there was an epidemic and many deaths which was well known in in medical history and so some of these early studies even then were having applications which now seem almost Paleolithic when we think of the work which is being done on Antonio Illinois and also on synaptic connectivity neuronal transmission and the effects not merely of genetics such as for example synaptic pruning but also of epigenetic modifications which no doubt we shall learn a lot more about in the coming decades but which even now seem to be telling us that the increase in um the kind of connectivity or um what's the word I'm really looking for that's connectivity is not the best word within the brain much more greater than anything which is possible within even growing chimpanzees let alone the adults or other great apes and this must have evolved somehow uh probably in relation to the appearance I suspect of the slowing down of childhood growth followed by the uniquely human homo adolescent growth spurt which was completely absent one and a half million years ago in early Homo erectus according to um Professor Christopher Dean and others and which must surely have been a response for The evolutionary change must have been a response to not merely no merely some kind of magical physiological change but more more likely to the effects of what we might call Behavioral responses and fundamentally it takes us back to active influence and to fundamental changes which are naturally slow uh to evolve and this is the part which is not recognized by most of our colleagues who work with living organisms on living primates and to that matter living human communities and individuals their perspective is not that I hope they'll forgive me for saying this which those of us who've been brought up in the Natural Sciences naturally come to expect they don't have the kind of cosmic time scale of cosmic spatial scale of things and of their the slowness and the imperceptibility of change which come naturally to those of us brought up from school days in a different tradition and I think this is very important because I think there is a big divide still between what um six years ago we knew as being named the two cultures I think this divide still exists um as that critic of our paper claimed we were post-modernists uh clearly represents um the more uh shall we say um intuitive relativistic view in which there is something which some of them believe to want to call an ethnographical Pleasant which I think is is a contradiction in terms otherwise it would be it could have been no evolution in Behavior but which wants to compare uh instead of contrast as I would have it uh what goes on in a few Generations let's say in a community computer smaller I don't know about a large one today with what went on over many many generations um as I said between 2 million and 200 000 years ago there would have been at least 80 000 Generations if each was 25 years long and even that is pushing it a bit given that adulthood in home of the actors was very likely achieved before the age of 15 and reproductive success was probably the next generation was probably um only a few years away this is important because as Professor Christian remote talking about cancer um our longevity um has allowed us to and of course I'm a better hygiene and medical knowledge but particularly our longevity has permitted us to survive in ways that were Unthinkable perhaps um in many parts of the world uh valid um well less than 100 years ago that wasn't merely thanks to antibiotics or even better hygiene in but to increases in standard of living going back perhaps perhaps um a few hundred years but let's not get into that what I really want to say is that next week I have to have a small vessel cell neoplasm removed from the side of my nose which only at the age of 80 or 81 became uh noticeable indicating that some of these um diseases which we we know the God is being a part and parcel of our Humanity or the aortic stenosis which was I was diagnosed with with my first and only ever incident of of um of um um cardiac failure about a year ago and has been successfully treated thanks though uh uh modern catheterization uh versus versus allow profitable prostheties to be but of the Prosthetics of uh to be placed on heart valves by a long catheter from the groin this kind of thing would have been Unthinkable um a few years ago in fact I can remember as an undergraduate um medical student watching the first ever open heart operations done by Alf gunning which was regarded in 1960 whether it was 63 64 as being something that might never might never succeed and nowadays is operations on our heart is just regarded as everyday cancers in cardiovascular units around the world things are changing and they're changing it within acceleration which we can only barely appreciate there are even those of us who now outlived our Portugal years and 10 and are on the verge of uh of defunct dysfunction however um we have to think in terms of the and this again is important of the exponential uh if you like or the crude leg scale at which things are happening and which are so influencing many people many of our colleagues in the humanities and in the social studies and indeed studies of animal behavior um including climate behavior of course and this I think is detracting from an appreciation of the long time scale and the um over which evolutionary processes have uh necessarily do take place I don't believe in Welch Smith's um hopeful monsters magical genes some people believe that there's a magical Gene in Homo sapiens switched on our cognitive ability I think this is this is wishful thinking um indeed it's magical thinking in my view however um I suppose uh my own training would lead me to want to say that but I'm not there have been exceptions and one exception I should like to mention by name is an Emeritus Buffet mythology was eminent uh in Paleolithic studies of York University now Professor Jeff Bailey who over 40 years ago was pointing out the incremental ability of the time scales of recent archeology and if you like ethnography with those of the Paleolithic and the pleistocene and human evolution and this was not really well regarded at the time although it influenced me very greatly and um so there have been honorable exceptions um who certainly um influenced me um we do as I say stand on the shoulders of others we try to um make one of your small conference advances in birth methodology and in theoretical influences and deductions and I think that they uh we're finally coming to possibly begin to see how to bring together thanks to um especially Professor friston's insights and um methodological um what I'm trying to say methodological proposals and advances we need to see that it might be possible to square the circle to bring together the evolutionary very slow evolutionary development of the hierarchical um mind which characterizes our Guinness and actual processes which can underpin this undergird it can bring together the no I went in view which um most of us at the spouse in the west uh with a few exceptions which are too well known to be worth mentioning here um I'm sure Daniel knows more about them than I do um but um it's meaning to bring together uh the CRV of the evolution of species by natural selection of and within species and are Within part is important and it's beginning to bring it to together with what we can appreciate about human behavior which is so different from that of the right age and here I just like to make one final point which is that in another paper which we um which Hector and our co-authors along with um and Professor might read of UCLA um in um we pointed out that there has been too much in our view uh hopeful or wishful thinking about the human nature of great apes certainly their behavior is very uh different from that of um many other orders of mammals and not to mention uh other failure uh other um classes within the animal kingdom however there is a big difference and I think this difference uh is best um emphasized by going back to the growth curve of humans and of human behavior in relation to our childhood in particular our infants are capable by about the age of three of putting of combination combinatorial uh thinking in ways that are virtually impossible or outside the scope of the behavior of most um gray tapes most of the time and almost certainly in the wild and this I think uh demands an explanation which is more than simply saying no the apes are really more like us it's just that we don't recognize this no I think that there is a difference and the time scale uh has to be taken into consideration which it often is not and most importantly this brings it move back to my last point and the first one which is that finally we're beginning to get together thanks to Professor Christensen Kristen's insights to seeing the possibility of tying together the biological evolution and if you like um the psychological Evolution certainly I would say the neurobiological evolution which has characterized our Guinness and characterizes it today in a unique way and with that no that's my case thank you Michael many many ways to go the dinner plate balanced on top of the stick and I think that's the cognitive moment where the top-down constraints and opportunities of our enabling architectures which for a long time included primarily what was on board and then over the last several thousand years progressively included Niche modifications and stigmergic modifications like writing and so just like in the SPM toolkit for studying brain function there are brain regions that have statistical connections that aren't necessarily anatomically connected and vice versa and when we consider information spaces we have similar connectivity patterns some are like information anatomy and some are more like information physiology in narrative or rhetorical spaces that becomes part of our extended cognitive selves and leave to others in the best possible way those who want bright lines of what is a self there are analytic Frameworks that respect continuities and discontinuities with an emphasis on the respect the continuities we want them to be differentiable and integrated and generalized coordinates of motion and the continuous time active inference models and the path integral formulation and then the discrete time generative model which is also a map not the territory helps us understand saltatory Maneuvers over multiple time scales and looking back at the literature and the discourse discussions like well is evolution gradual or general uh and jumping these have been some of the biggest touch points are things slowly changing or fast changing those are where certain lines were drawn and the methodological developments Bayesian graphs and so on and so on have provided a instrumentalist lens that as a matter of fact does integrate these Frameworks methodologically that is a claim that hardly anyone dissents from and then what happens with respect to our past present and future when we realize that we're after the moments of intra and among disciplinary tension not pushing the the rock up the hill anymore or trying to bring somebody else along but gardening in a space that already is how we need it to be could I make a comment uh Daniel yeah just occurred to me that when we think of the formant frequencies that affect all of the harmonics and other aspects of our vocalizations whether speech chanting song or even whistling perhaps it is unlikely or improbable that these very many variants which occur in different languages throughout the world with they're very very different characteristics and which former certainly began had begun to evolve quite considerably by the time that early writing appears about five thousand years ago but it's still unlikely that these can be taken back into the past on a slow evolving time scale such that they can be related directly in a direct evolutionary line to the vocalizations as I say of great apes from a common ancestor that we have with them six million years ago if we accept this uh unlikelhood then it seems equally unlikely to me that we can talk about cultural transmission or technological transmission in a slow uh um uh uniform manner invariant manner over the past let's say two million years from which we have information about different technical skills and Technical abilities uh or at least um so we say technical possibilities that were exploited by our organist or no and therefore I would argue that it is equally likely that the unawareness of what people what individuals will actually enacting the unawareness by bystanders onlookers or even their very protagonist uh protagonists of those activities themselves uh was a continuous and continuous Evolution over let us say 80 or at least 60 000 Generations in a continuous invariant manner this seems unlikely and it seems equally unlikely that the same is true of different uh linguistic shall we say abilities or aptitudes in other words as Professor for instance was remarked in more than one paper it does seem that the advantages that were taken uh were taken not on a continuous manner but in a discontinuous manner when particular communicative skills had developed in some groups such as to be able to widen their social scope for active influence and ahead of all by an actual selection within a shared framework of adaptive prior beliefs favoring alignment of common expected expectations and Joint activities affecting their ecological niche formation or development and this it seems to me is a a very expedient way of looking at how things happened or likely to have happened whether we will ever be able to produce um a theoretic in terms of formal version proposal for this I don't know I would like to think so but I really don't know how I don't have the competence to begin to do this myself um but I think that it is it will if it is possible it will certainly be to put it mildly a challenge to those who tend to think that there is a rapid jump uh well rapid jump took place uh which shall we say a small Gap there's only a small Gap that separates us from the great apes of the um of the equatorial latitudes of the old world I think that that took a lot much longer period of time and I don't think that one could I don't think that uh to compel what modern even shall we say in inverted Commerce relatively simple or primitive communities uh do or how they act is commensurable with the behavior of modern great apes frankly I would uh I would like to challenge this and I would hope that it might be possible to produce a model which will permit the theoretic which will permit The evolutionary process to believe at least interpreted in an alternative fashion so I didn't mean to be long-winded I apologize the classical information is inscribed on the holograph in the classical sedimentary layers is muted sorry in the in the holograph we have the inscription of the classical information and the quantum cognitive moment is the unpacking or the rotation of what is on the holograph into the information space and that I think was provocatively raised when you asked what if this was all there ever was what if there wasn't a secondhand ax to find out that field site that's the interpretive moment and how we interpret it is everything so in our final 10 minutes of this continuous 53.1 if each of us could provide a kind of closing just several minutes or any several thoughts on anything they'd like to add into this session or any directions that they would like to seed or prompt for next week's 53.2 I have something Daniel that would like to contribute before we we close the session uh I would like to take advantage the professor please donate with us because I have some um questions for him that had to do with the priority principle and to copy and not to copy if you allow me to just formulate it and first thing I would like to do is that there were some losses in my argumentation before I want to make clear that chimpanzees and learn socially this is something we know for sure so there is social learning and there is even cultures as Professor Andre Witten in in San Andreas proven such as demonstrated so there are some cultural tradition what is lacking is uh accumulation of complexity what is called by Michael tomasello ratcheting up okay so from one generation to the next every generation builds upon what was produced in last generation so you have a tool Implement and you modify it you make it more complex so our technology is the result of many people accumulating their knowledge so it's kind of a joint Endeavor this I wanted to make clear and what the models propose theoretical and and other kind of models is that copying with Fidelity is key to have this acceleration of complexity so what I wanted to correct is that the puzzle is that High rates I mean innovativeness does not realize in an accretation of complex technology because there is a lack of coping with fidelity what is called true imitation for some and for Jerusalem and ambition they call it impersonation so I see someone doing something I copy the the means and the result so chimpanzees are more prompted or likely to to emulate which is copying the end result but by their own devices so they can do different things to produce the same result and it appears that coping with Fidelity is is key and I'm I'm I'm cutting this a long explanation I just wanted to correct this for the sake of of purity of Science and now my question for Professor Crystal if you allow me um there is something interesting that the team of Andrew Witten in in San Andreas observed and that is in our paper that there was one instance that I know of when there was this kind of accumulation of complexity in chimpanzes and the thing was possible because these chimpanzees that combine two different techniques to make something more complex we could be a kind of premi Genius example of what we call this a creation of ratcheting up or behavior they did it because they had performed or enacted these behaviors before and this is for me it's very intriguing because thinking of how um in 2010 there is this paper by priests and another people where they they talk of the generative models under the furniture principle and they talk of an active inference like genetic model or not the structural representation is nothing that you enact you entail with your whole body so to speak accordingly wisdom so I'm thinking that this guy this team punches that they were able to have these complex a tool product they had enacted the behaviors independently before so by wondering if this enacting the behavior before allow them to overcome surprising because this would be we go to the core of this idea of an active inference like if you have performed those things separately with your body then the surprise is kind of bounded and you can produce this more complex product I mean I I don't know if that was clear enough but this is something that is intriguing to me and sure Carl as your as your last thought feel free to address that or anything else then well yes I'm just reflecting on on that um I think very important question I mean it is certainly the case that all of the um the active inference formalism um both in Neuroscience but also in terms of you know Ensemble Dynamics and self-organization of collections of um things um rests upon um a generative model of the consequences of my action um even to the extent You could argue uh from a theological perspective that all our perception is just in service of deciding what's the best thing to do next and literally how to move next uh just acknowledging that only a very limited number of ways you can actually change the universe you can either move a striated muscle or you can secrete something there's not much else you can do and so um you know it becomes very important in terms of um your characteristic state of being and to have the right generative models that choose the right ways to move your muscles or to speak things um and that places embodied action or having um um embodimented in activism at the center of the generative models and it certainly makes sense to me from the point of view of um but the statistician and um a machine learning Enthusiast that it would be um it would be much easier to revise or update a generative model in the sense you were intonating in terms of um accommodating the next kind of behavior um you know I'm not sure what this is composing a sequence of behaviors but certainly being able to incrementally um embellish um uh or adopt a behavior if you had already a precursor that was inherent in the structure or could be scaffolded within your genitive model so I mean the idea here is that everything that goes on the outside has to be in some structural and dynamic way recapitivated on the inside in order for you to control the outside and this and this of course is is at the heart of early formulations of things like the free energy principle in cybernetics you know Russia's good regulative theorem would say literally a thousand subsequent formulations in terms of uh laws or acquisite variety that the degrees of freedom on the inside um have to correspond to the degrees of freedom on the things on the outside to have to be controlled in the environment and so I think I think that's absolutely right that if you had already established through having an internal model of a particular Behavior a particular way of deploying my actuators and making sense of that and you know being able to um to infer it was me that did that and this is me doing that and this is the kind of thing that I do then you are in a much stronger position to um learn um or incorporate or to imitate um something that you have uh witnessed to Novo um and mathematically the reason why that becomes easier is the the um the cost of belief updating in its most General mathematical sense so I'm not talking about personal beliefs I'm just talking about any belief entail by the structure the connectivity uh the plasticity or indeed uh say neural activity any belief updating comes along with a cost um and that cost is um can be variously articulated in terms of a failure to generalize informationally uh thermodynamically it has you know a cost uh via landauer's principle um but mathematically it's interesting that it the cost is the relative entropy between your prior and posterior beliefs so this will be like a computational cost a complexity cost what that means is to make these steps be they gradual or be they um big jumps um they can only be made um if they're to use one of your words um if they're um they are suitably bounded in terms of the complexity cost which means the degree of belief updating literally the relative entropy or the cow Divergence between the implicit posterior and prior after the update is sufficiently Smalls which means literally you're changing your mind in a sort of mathematical sense in the most efficient way possible so if you're already close to um and have the right kind of generative model to do imitation of a de novo um behavior in Virtual the fact you've done it before that means that the the complexity cost of actually committing to that and revising and belief updating your generative model as now becomes within a tenable range it becomes acceptable so that you know that would certainly make sense if I was simulating that um and um you know we've been talking about ways of um all sorts of different questions expressions in the chat that you know these questions um um and The Plea um from Michael you know how would you make this Mechanics Work in terms of resolving various hypotheses and um um invincing insights into how all of this works I think at the end of the day you're going to have to simulate it um and um you know there's this a couple of uh this has not been done very much in the setting of the free energy principle or active infant certainly but they're now are a number of papers coming out within the past year or a few months and uh you know it might be interesting to go to those and I'm thinking of uh for example um a paper by Casper hesp's group that looked I think the final write-up is something like one small step for mankind or something but it was originally entitled um ideas worth spreading so it's explicitly using the Bayesian mechanics of belief updating to look at how um how spreadable how copyable certain um certain beliefs were um framed in the in the current age of the internet and sort of tweet tweets and the like and the same kind of theme has also been taken up by uh colleagues of Conor Heinz and Maxwell Randstad in terms of um simulating epistemic communities where coming back to Michael's use of the uh you know the importance of epistemic spread and copying uh video and imitation being basically an epistemic spread that's now starting to be simulated so I think we are on the cusp in the world of active inference at least on having um mechanics out there that's actually realized in silica that you can start to intervene on and model things of this kind of that kind and speaking to Dean's question earlier on you know it strikes me that the people in climatology must face exactly the same problem is this missing data or did this thing actually go away and of course it's a really important uh really important question to answer then in principle you could do it if you've got a model of those Legacy data you have to have a model which means you've got to basically have an in silicone um sort of digital twin of the way you think it works and then you can compare two generative models or digital twins on the way it works and see which has the greatest evidence in light of the historical data that clearly hasn't been done either in climate change or or or or your field but in principle that would be the way to you know way to do that I'm sorry I've gone over time sorry it's totally fine Carl my my reflection on that as we again anyone else who wants to have any last um words is in the par at all 2022 textbook there's attention to two kinds of surprise plain surprise which is an information theoretic quality quantity associated with an observation with respect to its prior and the second being Bayesian surprise which is what you just described the uh cost of movements which is the related to the Divergence of movements and I think in that difference between that was surprising and I surprised me or I have changed are two aspects of the scenario because to just be surprised doesn't require one to change at all one can just say every day wake up check the news I can't believe that they're doing that you can just be surprised again and again and then there's the Bayesian surprise with the belief updating and that is really where the semantic advances of the Bayesian mechanics are just beginning to mature I I hate the last word but and I hope it isn't um so the propagations have been dropped in 53.0 and 53.1 and um Daniel and Dean have avoided being provocateurs so far um what I'm really looking forward to is in 53.2 whether we can declare game on because I think if we do if we have that to look forward to we can push the narrative to the end of the timetable and we can start to or continue to enhance the conversation that we initiated today so I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of the uh the care and the passion that you um shared with us and I'm just I'm just happy as can be so thank you thank you any final comments Hector Michael no just thank you for having us and sharing this time with us I mean it was being great discussion thank you well thank you very much uh it's been most most profitable session excellent Carl any last thoughts again this I've enjoyed it greatly um and you know it's a real pleasure to actually speak to yeah to all of you but in particular uh Michael and Hector you're actually using words that's spoken words very embodied very natural lovely excellent all right till next time thank you everybody bye
