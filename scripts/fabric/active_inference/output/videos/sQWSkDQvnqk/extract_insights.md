- The free energy principle provides a framework for understanding scientific modeling and cognitive processes.
  
- Modularity in cognitive systems allows for distinct functions while enabling communication and interaction between modules.

- The relationship between agents and their environment is crucial for understanding cognitive processes and scientific inquiry.

- Active inference emphasizes the role of the observer in shaping scientific models and interpretations of reality.

- Cognitive realism can bridge the gap between individual and collective scientific activities through a shared understanding of models.

- The concept of Markov blankets helps delineate boundaries between internal cognitive states and external environments.

- Scientific activity is inherently social, involving collaboration and communication among diverse agents and artifacts.

- Partial encapsulation allows for information transfer between cognitive modules while maintaining some degree of independence.

- Effective connectivity captures the dynamic relationships between neural elements, influencing our understanding of cognition and behavior.

- Active inference supports adaptive behavior by minimizing uncertainty about the environment through predictive modeling.

- The interplay of functional and effective connectivity enriches our understanding of complex systems in cognitive neuroscience.

- Science as a collective endeavor requires integrating individual insights and contributions for a comprehensive understanding of phenomena.

- The philosophical implications of scientific modeling extend beyond empirical findings to include social and cognitive dimensions.

- Understanding the roles of observers in scientific processes challenges traditional notions of objectivity and representation.

- The evolution of scientific thought relies on addressing the complexity of interactions between agents and their contexts.

- Future research should focus on integrating social aspects into philosophical discussions of scientific realism and model-making.
