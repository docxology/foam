- The distinction between modularity and non-modularity is essential in cognitive science debates.
- Scientific models are influenced by the practical goals of the modeler.
- Cognitive systems may have varying degrees of information encapsulation and modularity.
- The historical context of scientific models is vital for understanding their development and application.
- Observational tools can shape our understanding of cognitive processes and scientific inquiry.
- Information transfer between cognitive modules can be complex and context-dependent.
- Active inference provides a framework for understanding cognitive processes in dynamic environments.
- The social aspects of scientific inquiry should be incorporated into cognitive science discussions.
- Effective and functional connectivity help delineate relationships between cognitive processes and brain activity.
- The role of the observer introduces complexity in interpreting scientific models.
