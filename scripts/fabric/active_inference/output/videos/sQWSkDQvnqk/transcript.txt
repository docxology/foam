[Music] [Music] hello and welcome everyone it is january 12 2022. we are here in actin flab live stream number 35.2 discussing the paper a tale of two architectures free energy its models and modularity welcome to the actin flap we are an online participatory lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference you can find more information on this slide this is a recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work if you're watching live feel free to write questions in the live chat if you're watching in replay you can also add comments all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams all of our activities in the lab are participatory so if you would like to contribute or get involved go to activeinference.org and see what is there today in live stream 35.2 we're going to be having our third discussion continuing on the paper a tale of two architectures free energy its models and modularity written by majeed benny who we're really appreciative is joining us today to talk and see where it goes so we'll um get to the introduction in a second but basically we're gonna just pick up on some of the threads that we opened in earlier discussions we have a few specific things written down and i'm sure we'll go many different ways with people joining and ideas coming up and questions in a live chat and all of that so we can kind of go any which way but we'll just start with the introduction and warm up so we can each say hello maybe blue and i can just say what we're excited about for the dot two and then mageed it'd be awesome to hear any context for the paper so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in california and i didn't expect the rabbit duck to appear in dot one but i'm looking forward to continuing that and seeing how is this drawing like a scientific model and then what does that philosophical or conceptual paradox or ambiguity say about scientific modeling so blue i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico and i am excited to probe deeper into the relationship um between agents and their environment and also the intransitivity um argument and modularity and how those kind of all fit together excellent ajit you are muted and then please continue so hello you can hear me no so uh i'm magic i'm an assistant professor of philosophy at metoo middle east technical university and i'm obsessed with models and structures across science and perception and mind and this is for it's for a while that i'm engaged with this issue of model applying model-based approach to science to free energy principle and predictive coding and i'm very happy to be here thank you very much for inviting me great well maybe just for like background and context what brought you to write this specific paper like recognizing modularity as an important topic and where does this fit into some of your other threads related to fep and model based science um well well that's a very good question i'm not uh quite sure why so one reason for uh focusing on modularity in this paper is that uh most probably it has some sort of psychological explanation because i started to learn about philosophy of mine and philosophy of collective science by reading this language of toads and i think that even in the earlier stages when i was when people were studying there no one was thinking that the brain is actually a syntactical engine no one was thinking that if you open up a brain or a cognitive system you actually find things that are inside the brain in terms of uh propositional like entities language like entities or syntactical engines or anything of that sort but at the same time people were believing that that perspective on hold brain works uh have some sort of explanatory gain there is something that we can learn by taking that perspective on uh the brain and cognitive system and well i think that uh the general idea behind beyond behind applying this model-based approach to sciences is that it is the explanatory interest explanatory as well as practical interests of the modeler of the people who are engaged with scientific enterprise that uh provide a handle on the target system the things that we try to explore and understand and uh well uh i think that then i was reading uh uh the target paper uh by uh by kirchoff and hippolytu uh well uh what what stroked me as odd was that uh they were taking it very very much for granted true of course through very well articulated and philosophical arguments that [Music] there is no such modularity inside the brain or cognitive system and i just wanted to bring the point to attention that it would be a matter of as i said earlier practical and explanatory goals and interests of the modeler whether there is a modularity there or not so uh one thing that i i'm going to emphasize underline in this session is that it doesn't need to lead i mean this model relativity it doesn't need to lead to uh dawn right materialism about uh theories of brain and cognitive system i mean model relativity is not all about taking an untreatable attitude toward brain science but at the same time so the the old goal the old project is to end up with some sort of subtler perspective on scientific realities about cognitive science and and the brain science you for the context welcome dean if you'd like to say hello and um if you have any opening shots to fire i i don't have any opening shots of fire my name's dean i'm in calgary i'm uh sorry for coming in late but my link was sending me off into another corner of the uh universe so glad i'm here thanks for uh thanks for being here majido really glad that you're here to talk about this paper i found the paper fantastic pleasure is all mine so modularity i mean it's in the title modularity models and then the free energy um and then the tale of two architectures which was a little bit of a reference towards the tale of two densities another active paper so um just how would you reframe the argument of hippolyto and kirchoff majeed and where do you think like in 22 what can we say now that we couldn't have said in 2019 oh well what well i do not think that we could say anything more than we were saying in 2019 because all of the actual stuff was there i think that this is something that comes with philosophy because uh no information has been added as a matter of fact i just elaborated on the information that was there in terms of the argument from intransitivity and all of that discussion of uh causal modelling and dynamical modeling and all that so uh i don't think that any actual information has been added the only thing that has been elaborated on was the emphasis on the rule of the modeler the uh which if we insist on uh so as i was watching this in the previous discussion of uh of uh the same paper in active inference lab uh and uh i was so dean's discussion of the in terms of the bob alice uh metaphor the discussion of the perspective of the observer the observer that is watching both bob and alice uh interested me very much so if i want to rephrase the discussion of the modeler in terms of information here we can as well start real estate that's in terms of the observer but uh i think i don't think that the point is that technical the point is rather philosophical than scientific or formal in terms of information theory so uh no actual information has been added during these two years only and i think that this approach is gaining momentum this emphasize on the rule of uh modeler or interpreter is uh drawing even more this uh is leading to even more discussions in the free energy principle literature i totally agree with that point and then blur dean um it made me think of quantum and how the double slit experiment kind of kicking and screaming has taken 100 years in that one limited setting to consider the role of the observer even though it's really complex thing we won't go into it but we'll talk about quantum and fep um in a few weeks but that was like the anomaly that signaled yeah you need to take the observer into account as part of the measuring apparatus very quantitative empirical observation that there was a non-negotiable or um irreducible role of the observer and then on the qualitative side the relational insight that scientists are human and science is a human activity and um that was not driven on uh empirical observations of wave and particle on a screen like the twin slit was but it was just a sort of low level philosophical argument that there isn't a uh a fungible role for the observer or the modeler and so it is very interesting to see how that has started to catch on and then how does that change the way we do science when that is taken [Music] as like a starting point that there's an observer modeling the system um so like that was in this diagram when we started with um just talking about like the functional and the effective connectivity and then the mechanism which is kind of not either those and then it wasn't until the very end when we're like oh but it's the scientist projecting in to this whole model that's another level of how we think about it we can't just like all be sitting around just talking about bob and alice but then now there's going to be us with multiple perspectives looking at the scientists taking multiple perspectives on bob and alice so are we stuck in this sort of subjective infinite regress how are we going to salvage cognitive realism are you asking me anyone but if you have any thoughts definitely go for it i have some ideas but i i mean i prefer if other how about yeah dean and then majida than blue if you want to well one of the things majid that i that i took away from reading your paper was this is this is funny because typically when i when i pick something up it's pretty foreign to me it starts out being way on the other side of a markov blanket and then i i guess i somehow alright i'm able to sort of get inside of it and relate it back to the things that i know and eventually i get it a bit of a grip on it and then next thing you know there's four duck rabbits um spinning madly out of control on a on a on a gradient but one of the things that i took away from this was um and i think i mentioned it in the in the point one is is are you nine o'clocking when we're taking these slices in time and we're building these models my question was what are the specifics of that i mean if if we take an fmri image i know the the machine itself that's taking those slices of time isn't necessarily conscious but it is carrying out some sort of an instantiation exercise and so one of the things i wanted to kind of talk to you a little bit about not necessarily on a quantum level but one of the sections of your paper which was really really influential to me was a section on a golden thread i wanted to i was hoping that perhaps within that idea of partitioning whether it's through quantum quantum methodology or quantum series or whatever if you could maybe talk a little bit about that that idea of what you meant by a golden thread not just metaphorically but maybe materially and maybe influentially if there is such a word because that part of it really mattered to me and i it actually got me writing a whole set of sub notes based on that section so maybe maybe you could expand on that a little bit because i think there's a lot there thanks dean for the great question so yes we'd love to learn more about the golden thread unmute and then continue i i thought that uh so very well uh so if i may do a bit of advertisement uh i have been discussing this specifically this specific issue this dog rabbit thing in another paper which is published in a philosophy journal it is named cognitive penetration and cognitive realism and it is published in in episode it relates this issue to uh the issue of theory ladenness in philosophy of science works of thomas green and all that but uh so i can't uh so uh well what i say here so i'm also interested in the relation between feb and quantum theory and uh i'm i'm working on a project that relates steps to cubism in as one of the significant interpretations of quantum mechanics but uh in this context uh i cannot so the paper is not directly related or even indirectly to quantum mechanic and the rule of observer i rather take some sort of so if i want to say this in more technical terms i would use shannon's theory of information to uh to articulate the rule of the observer a bit clearer so about the question if i understand it correctly what happens when the picture rotates and there's a scanning of some sort of scanning is taking place whether uh so i correctly understand that your question is about what happens when there is a rotation but there is no observer to uh want to work out whether it is a dog or a rabbit right and then the whole business of so so when we're trying to encapsulate something and you you spoke clearly in the in the paper about we we don't necessarily have to see this as a as a hard and fast edges kind of thing we can kind of appreciate that there's a certain amount of fuzziness that's actually enabling our conversation and so that because the lines aren't abrupt and and when we do decide to put a markov blanket around something it's us choosing to do that at a certain scale with a certain amount of specificity and steven sillett in the point one talked about so what what is available at a meso scale so that golden thread business that what do we last sue what is that fmri actually trying to entail that's what i was hoping that you could maybe tease out for us a little bit very well also uh i can't be all clear about that because being a philosopher i'm a bit naive about neuroimaging and that sort of stuff but as some sort of general insight and trivial insight from philosophy of science i would say that it would depend on what we are trying to trace by using a fmri or any other observational device or measurement so and the fact that we could use this measurement devices in a number of different ways and by by devices i do not only refer to actual devices but also theoretical devices such as markov blankets and that sort of stuff so and applying that to different scales and different different levels doesn't need to mean that there is no object effect of matter to be represented by these devices so uh i might be able to use different theoretical and mathematical devices to measure the space of my room uh i may be able to use for example kilometers i or i may be able to use with noodles or something of that sort and uh this doesn't mean that there is no fact of matter to be to be measured after all we can see this picture in terms of either rabbit or a duck but not as a dog or a cow for example and whether we see it as a dark or rabbit again is influenced by so uh it i would say that to some extent it will depend on the original vagueness of the picture to what extent the subjectivity to what extent can affect the perception what we see is a matter of uh the target system itself the properties of the target system itself so [Music] i mean no matter how hard we drive we could hardly be able to see this duck or rabbit as a cow or a dog or something else but at the same time to some extent especially when the target system allows for some vagueness to some extent or presuppositions or goals and intentions be around the actual situation and uh so there is some sort of constraint or a moderate amount of theoreticalness to use a jargon by philosophy philosophers of science that is taking place here but it doesn't mean that there is no i mean it doesn't need to strip the target of all of its objective features i still i i'm still not sure whether i could address your worry correctly or not because i couldn't see the point about the fmri and neuroimaging techniques so well all i was i guess i'm kind of i'm agreeing with the argument that you're putting forward which is that any time we make an observation and then we drop some kind of a representation we call that a model even in those even in those efforts to try to be precise we have to leave open a little bit of latitude a little bit of wiggle room because as you pointed out you can have a dynamic causal model and to get into an argument whether or not that's the appropriate model it should be an acyclic one right for example that was what you were saying and that kind of gets you going down a path of arguing about which is the right tool as opposed to saying do tools leverage right i think that's what maybe that's what i was reading into what you were trying to say that's all thanks dean um blue and then majeed so i think this kind of goes into um what dean was saying about scale-friendly versus scale-free and so like with a markov blanket and with like this um you know uh denotation of a module whether it's vertical or horizontal uh a horizontal or vertical mod module um you know we impute the markov blanket on whatever scale we're trying to separate conditionally so i just wanted to to bring that that point um back in and also um that this idea of maybe like in incomplete partitioning so i mean if there was a a complete partition around each module um there would be like no ability to transfer information from module to module and in the brain i mean we do know that that definitely um some the pieces have to communicate to make the entire brain or it wouldn't be considered an organ you know we wouldn't be able to mark off blanket you know these this idea of nested markov blankets so i don't know about this information encapsulation or or information leakiness magetta would be nice if you um maybe kind of unpacked that a little bit more for us yes the information encapsulation topic so uh the thing is that i can't see uh for some reason i can't see you in this picture and i have to shift to the youtube page in order to see you and it's called you can maybe go to on the bottom bar toggle tile view there's like i use that but it's all right it's for some reason i can't see that there are pages of people but i cannot just see your faces it is it shows d the initial and b it may have to do with what countries we're all in which is totally fine at least we have audio let me try it once more with well oh yes at least we have audio so very well so uh uh uh well about information encapsulation uh shelley ex try to explain that in terms of that bob alice metaphor great yeah information encapsulation as applied to the bob alice parable all right very well so for one thing this information encapsulation is one of the features of uh jerry fodor's original statement of uh the thesis of modularity and so uh which which is quite uh flexible a flexible thesis and motives so for me in the way that i see that model relativity entails this kind of modularity information encapsulation because in order to have model and again it can be stated in terms of market blankets and whether the mark of blankets are embodied or nested or not is itself another issue but the very fact that we can use markov blanket or markovian models it indicates that we can we are able to set some sort of in barriers conditional independence between uh internal and external spaces so in order to state this free energy principle of crystalline there's uh interpret these spaces in terms of active spaces and sensory spaces but at the same time it indicates that there is some sort of barrier even though if the barrier is conditional and probabilistic i do not think that for information encapsulation we need anything stronger than this kind of flexible conditional barrier between inside and outside or between different spaces and this is the point that uh so when i was watching your discussion in the previous uh session zero three five point one uh i saw that this metaphor of bob and alice came out and there was the question of whether there is any sort of cause or relation between them and whether the relation between them is anyway correlated so as i argued in the paper they may be some sort of causal relation or correlation uh which can be stated in terms of internal interventionist approaches which are of course liable to their own uh to other sorts of criticism that we don't need to discuss right though but uh i think that information encapsulation doesn't need anything that stronger than the general model relativity that i tried to advertise advocate in this paper so the main point is that regardless of whether or not there is any kind of causal relation actual relationship between the actions of bob and the actions of uh alice or perhaps i have to call them uh charles and lucy in order to be more loyal to the ruler to the soul of the tale of two cities uh the thing is that to the extent that the information in each unit is not available accessible to the other unit we can speak of information encapsulation and then we are making models i mean if we can't set any kind of distinction between internal and external spaces and if we can't in the same way that we may not be able to set a distinction between models and their targets there wouldn't be any modeling practice there wouldn't be any scientific activity on the other hand if we are able to set a distinction between internalized external or any kind of distinction between uh models and their target we would be able to to state some sort of conditional barrier it still doesn't indicate that there is no kind of information uh uh so it setting the barrier by itself doesn't show that the information in one block is not available to the other black but uh the yeah and i can't see the uh yeah i i was fascinated by this picture when i was watching your discussion in the previous session so uh in terms of the relationship between bob and alice the action of bob brushing the teeth is a correlated with what alice does in the other unit but it has been assumed that the information in the unit is not available the information in bob unit is not available to alice and vice versa even though the information may be available to us as observers or if we contrive another observer a third person the information might be available to her to the observer but to the extent that the information in each unit is not available to the person in the other units i think that we can speak of some sort of partial information encapsulation thanks very uh interesting if we couldn't i just really like calling that part about how if we couldn't make a distinction between the target system and the model between the territory and the map then it's not modeling so it's kind of like well when you kick a football does it model a parabola well it doesn't have the modeling the self model the integrated world model whatever one wants to call it such that it is just the actual causal relationships that it's engaging in the world and no more whereas cognitive entities like scientists are engaging in [Music] modeling and then that means that they are able to engage in counter factuals in thinking through other minds they are reducing their uncertainty from a partial information encapsulation view and sometimes you get more information than the system has available but other times it's radically less and so it's kind of like an application of a markov blanket partitioning with some non-markov concepts from philosophy of science to the scientists investigating target systems getting partial measurements that's their observations coming in and then they're updating their hidden state inference about what they think is happening the likelihood of different hypotheses just like any active entity would well if i may elaborate a bit more on this and it returns to the question of cognitive realism uh i think that despite speaking of all of this model relativity it doesn't need to lead to some sort of global or uh general form of anti-realism because well uh a part of my activity in the past years was dedicated to developing some sort of cognitive reality that is based on flip assuming that the practice of scientific model making is underpinned by the dynamical interaction between scientists or groups of scientists and their environment so this kind of model relativity i mean the relation between free energy principle and model based science is very complicated and it is not something that is directly related to this aspect of them of this paper but this paper is a piece of a larger project that has been finding its own shape in the past few years and it is about the uh as i say the general idea here is that in the same even though the free energy principle the theoretical framework experimental activity that is embodied in the research stream that leads to the development of free energy principle is basically some sort of model based scientific activity on the other hand if you are interested in explaining scientific activity and scientific model making and if you are naturalist we are interested in finding good natural explanations for that we have to look into the underpinning natural mechanism that makes scientific model making possible right and a good place to look for that is the scientific accounts of the interaction between the agent the organism and the environment and because free energy principle provides a viable account of the relation between agents or as i discussed in my more recent work a group of agents which is the community of scientists and their environment both social environment and biological environment we can as well grow in scientific model making in the mechanisms of free energy principles so the situation is quite complicated and runs in both direction we like running in both directions so i guess that's okay um so we have a few different ways we could go dean or blue do you want to ask a question or we can go to one that we've previously written down can i ask a quick question daniel yes yeah so in the in the point one blue brought up something that i'm still sort of trying to untangle when she talked she was asking about genes in particular and how it might relate to what this paper was potentially pointing to at least it raised the specter around the idea of so information encapsulation do we need time in order for us to be able to take a measure or put a boundary around or encapsulate or somehow mark in a markovian way decide where the partition is and so i'm still trying to figure out whether or not we are talking about a world where because i think a world exists where there are two things going into not necessarily the same direction we got one thing where we look at the world and we ask ourselves whether something was completed we do a completion analysis we take an account and i think models fit nicely into that world what i thought this paper raised some some ideas around was is that half of the if is that half of the whole picture is the other half do models and and being modular allow us to include or make sure that we have included everything that we need in order to be able to get the best sense of what's on the other side of that divide so when we're making these inferences we can use models as a way to account for things but are we also able to project off of that and and sort of make better guesses better inferences i've used that i've used the expression prediction matter expert and so i i was wondering again those words weren't exactly used in this paper but was that part of what we were trying to sort of dig down to is it is it is it just a matter of people use models people people's models account for things in in in certain ways but they also if we don't get too hung up on the precision of that account they can also be sort of fuzzy and left semi-open and give us an opportunity to also be creative and decide essentially whether or not we have enough information to make that next best guess so just kind of wondering about that yes please all right very well that's a that's a very brilliant point so uh it it comes back to the issue of completeness of models their accuracy certainty and that sort of stuff and completely agree so uh it uh it has been taken for granted and i think that part of it part of this interest has been rised by richard levine's uh paper the strategy of model-based science in population biology that we are making models but the accuracy of models is very important so the models have to be accurate enough to represent uh to do the representational task well and they have to be complete in the sense that they have to be detailed you know i think that this is very good point but look uh how much accuracy is enough i mean we can speak of completeness of models but uh absolutely complete models i think that uh i've been reading a shorter story from a north and american uh writer the on the executive of science or something like that which is the story of people in an empire who are trying model map makers cartographers who are trying to make maps of the empire and they are very obsessive they want to have conflict maps but they end up with having maps that are oh all right perfect poor house yes yes precisely so they end up with having maps that are as big as the empire itself so uh then at least so and it's completely true that levin's two speak of accuracy and detailedness of models but uh then again uh uh uh completeness in it so details i mean more details are not necessarily leading to better models because accuracy works only in combination with some other virtues such as generality and precision of predictions so even though uh so the other question is that home how to find how to strike the right balance between generality one hand and accuracy and precision of models on the other hand and i'm tempted to say that i understand that i'm just trying to point to the same direction to speaking of the rule of modal scientific models and model making but then again how much precision and accuracy have to be taken into account and have to be related to uh have to put in harmony with generality again i would i'm tempted to say that it is again a matter of interest and explanatory and predictive goals of the model maker so i will ask a question from the live chat from stephen so stephen majeed was curious about your understanding of the relationship in which practitioners seek to apply low dimensional computational modeling with other scales of knowing in uncertain and dynamic environments so for example there's the awareness and the perception of the duck rabbit and then there are the affordances in our niche that go beyond just sort of a visual toy example so open-ended question about what um you might think about that kind of application of modeling perhaps in a social setting do the models in the social setting need to be dimensional or what if i see that in terms of the relation between dynamical causal models and dags so for example i assume that dags could provide some sort of low dimensional model that is capable of representing the network aspects or something like that yeah i think that's a good question i mean continue with that and i'll write some things down all right very well so uh uh so uh i'd like to i'm tempted to repeat this uh well i think that it provides a good example so take the verb of social relation or social events that we may want to model so this provides actually a good nice example of multi-scale or multi-scale nature of target phenomena so this uh the social events is constituted by the relationship between people and event and environment and uh well people are actual human being they are biological entities constitute of uh people who are self-organizing system and we are able to explain people and their behavior at some level on the basis of uh biological facts so we may be uh able to use some sort of modeling system that are applicable in biology or that sort of stuff but at a larger scale when we try to model the relation between different people as nodes in networks and that sort of stuff we may need to change our modeling device to i don't know devices that are good at representing uh a small board networks or that sort of stuff if that does make any sense i think that i just get confused by the point about low dimensionality of models in social systems but um [Music] it could be a steven ism or one way at least that i would read that would be like the maps that we make are lower dimensional than the territories they have a different resolution but also they don't consider they're not trying to be a full inventory of every variable in the system like there might be a thousand chemicals circulating in our blood but then somebody might make a lower dimensional model with just blood sugar or two-dimensional model with just you know cortisol and blood sugar and um [Music] i think it's uh an active inference open question when we make lower dimensional models of complex multi-scale target phenomena like you addressed um [Music] it uh i mean i don't want to jump to and answer but it seems clear like that the philosophical implications of a lower dimensional map shouldn't be confused with systems accounting of the territory because it's not the same thing and um yeah steven just followed up in the chat he just said generally how does majeed see the informational or physical sense of systems like some people talk about systems in the more ontological sense about the parts and how they're connected other times we're talking about systems informationally like our analysis of the measurement data and so the system like the default mode network is a connectivity pattern that isn't necessarily the anatomical connection so how do we think about these different kinds of systems and maybe where does the fep come into play with that all right very well uh uh that's a very good question so i'm a tag you're a structural realist so i'm committed to some sort of information theoretic ontology and i think that uh well and i say that i'm defending some sort of embodied informational uh structure realism so uh when i say that i was advocating cognitive realism it was it would have been more precise to say that i'm advocating cognitive search or realism which is actually the title of the book that i wrote about this topic so uh and what rule free energy principle plays in this context uh is a very complex rule so let's assume that we have the structure of scientific theories or scientific models on the one hand so let's assume that we have a class of models or scientific models on on the one hand and on the other hand we have or causal structure of the word which is or target system something that we are trying to represent by or scientific model so uh when i speak about a structural realism uh i think that it has been the official wisdom of philosophy of science for the past uh 15 years or so and people were trying to use different kind of formal vehicles such as set theory model theory category theory to speak of this representational relation between the class of models and the causal structure of the world right but i uh so my beef with that was that the formal relations such as isomorphism do not contribute to strengthening realism because these formal models such as isomorphism are not informed to i mean you can use isomorphism to relate any two sets together provided that there have enough number of set members so it doesn't contribute to uh realism much so what i was trying to do was to use feb free energy principle to account for the class of models and their target system in the world assuming that scientists are self-organizing system that aim at minimizing the discrepancy between their models and their target system in the real world so uh but it is my take i mean it is something that i'm trying to develop i won't i don't say that this is the uh this is a very well uh this is not the orthodox view either in the philosophy of science common commodity or in the flip community but i think that uh when we speak of representation in terms of the representational capacity of the model of models in terms of the relation between class of models and causal structure in the world free energy principle can play a very subtle and a specific rule there maybe we're in a little strange neck of the woods but i think having scientists as real entities doing something seems at home here blue so i think you presented us with a lot of things that don't contribute to realism but is there anything that you think does contribute to realism [Music] well could you elaborate cbs uh i mean uh because of the model relativity or because of free energy principle well well so like in in terms of cognitive structural realism like what what does provide evidence for the cognitive structural realist argument i mean like you've given us a lot of things that you've deconstructed that but is there can you take the opposite side and provide evidence for cognitive structural realism or fair enough uh look the general i think that the general arguments for scientific realism in general have been always stated in some sort of uh numerical arguments assuming that if science was not representing the structure of reality it would be a matter of cosmic co in the empirical adequacy of science has been a matter of cosmic coincidence so there are some sort of uh arguments usual arguments in the philosophy of science that try to relate empirical adequacy of scientific theories to approximate truth of scientific theories right and uh structural realism just tries to model this representational relation the veracity of or variety verity called representational relations in terms of say theory and modal theory so in my view it would be more realistic to consider scientists as actual human being constitute by flesh and blood who aim at minimizing the discrepancy between their models and the world i would say that the evidence that i could provide for this take on realism uh could be has its roots in uh evolutionary biology because uh if if we had not been successful in minimizing the discrepancy between our models reality we would also fail to maximize or survey well so uh i think that i can in as a way of evidence or argument i can try to ground the argument the usual scientific realist argument that aim to relate the empirical adequacy of science to truths of theories i can try to relate the or success to maximizing or survival as an evidence of or success in minimizing the discrepancy between our scientific models and their target system the causal structure of reality thanks that also plays into some other discussions we've been having about like the objective function of science and this sort of multi-scale nature that scientific fields research labs and organizations and individuals are engaged in pragmatic and epistemic actions and so in active inference we have this scale-friendly approach which a priori doesn't require a specific scale of analysis which is what you brought up with markov blankets and any specific application will entail a specific scale of analysis because it's empirical and so it's this uh one foot in both world just like linear models are the model doesn't have uh a priori scale but then when we specify it we do make it specific and what's interesting about active is that we could think about this action and perception loop of different kinds of nested entities now definitely it's going to get complex for any nested entity and then it brings a whole other level with a strange loop and the meta modeling and the cognizer and the thinking about oneself that's like a whole another level but just a way to talk about vertically and horizontally interacting systems is an awesome start so blue and then uh either majeed you could respond to what blue says or dave feel free to say hello i just wanted to compliment you on that awesome like prelude to like next week's discussion about modeling ourselves right so like it's a very interesting perspective when when the modeler is the model is the modeler is the model it's a loop cool um dave would you like to say hello or ask anything or hi um nothing particular to ask i'm sorry to be late i've been in marinating myself in neuropsychoanalysis for the last week and a half so that's my closest i've got to an excuse for being late fair enough um so let's go to a few of the other topics that we had written down so i think before we get to this more the the liftoff on the post dot 2 let's talk a little bit about intransitivity because in our discussions we had looked at intransitivity in a preference framework where intransitivity of preferences has been transformational in microeconomics for example and then there's intransitivity from a game theoretic perspective like the rock paper scissors and just strategic intransitivity which also brings us back to the population biology modeling but you were discussing um intransitivity in a specific context which is about the predictive processing architectures and models of cognitive architecture so could you maybe unpack a little bit what does untrans intransitivity mean in that context who disagrees what would be different if it weren't that way uh yeah sure so uh i think that the uh so uh the thing is that if we assume that there is translativity information could be transferred from one unit to another uh we would have a serious problem in defending uh i was thinking of saying something more about active inference and objective inferences because but i will put that in the background for the time being but the thing is that uh the point that i was trying to make in the paper was that this all of this talk about uh the distinction between transitivity and intransitivity only works with regard to uh invoking a specific kind of model which is no wonder because the paper is about the significance of scientific models so we can defend transitivity or intransitivity of the cognitive structure depending on the kind of modeling that we summon so if we assume that the only kind of models that are allowable in the context of free energy principle or dynamical causal models we will end up by a straightforward rejection of modularity but this doesn't need to be the case because free energy principle is not all about uh representing the actual causal mechanisms neurophysiological mechanisms of the brain so uh this is as much about representing this neurophysiological structures as the general properties of the the it is as much about representing the local significant uh neurophysiological mechanism as it is about explaining the relation between different units and different component counterparts that are uh implemented in the brain so it is supposed to be a theory a unifying theory of the brain and in some sense it may indicate that we do not need modularity enough because if we want to defend some sort of unity between different components between different parts of the structure we do not need to be able to modulate the brain and the paper tries to argue the reverse that speaking of the connection between different parts in terms of mainly in terms of and again it comes back to the distinction between effective functionality and functional connectivity that you discuss very well most probably better than i would be able to in the previous session would be a matter of uh the kind of uh properties of the cognitive system that we aim to model by invoking free energy principle whether there are local properties of the brain or the global unifying properties of the brain and if you want to model the brain in its unity we also need to be able to speak about the connection between different parts and from the very fact that we assume that there are different parts uh it follows that we have to assume that there is some sort of encapsulation or a weak point a moderate form of modularity very interesting thank you any other thoughts on that well then i'm going to go to a hard question which is what makes a model active inference is that a uh in the in the circle or out of the circle is it a binary classifier is it a zero to one scale what will happen when people disagree does simply any model involving action and inference qualify as active inference um [Music] we have asked it on a few previous discussions and i think we've gotten a range of answers but it's definitely an important one to revisit from this model-based science perspective well i mean i have been defending some sort of pan psychism i have been marshaling free energy principle in defense of versions of pan psychism so uh i'm tempted to say that any kind of self-organizing system that can minimize the discrepancy between its internal models and the environment is capable of forming active inferences but uh it is not directly to i mean it is not specifically related to this issue of modal relativity unless we assume that uh model relativity is quite obvious it is everywhere in scientific activity i cannot find any specific relation between that kind of pan psyches account of active inference and a specific discussion of model relativity dana can ask a question yep dean and then blue sorry blue maybe you want to go first you put your hand up and i just blurted out go ahead dean okay sorry about that thanks so in at the end of the last of the last live stream there was a question posted in the live chat about so does active i know maybe this ties in with what you were just asking daniel does active inference what does active inference tell us about the model of the person trying to kick the ball and i'm i'm curious about this because you wrote another paper with a you co-authored a paper on active inference and abduction with somebody if i pronounced their last name incorrectly i apologize p pia taranin and and i'm kind of curious because i think what active inference enacting an active inference within model building and modularity is it it it gets us asking a question much like charles saunders pierce would ask if you walked in late on bob and alice okay it's nine o'clock but you're not really paying attention to the clock right now you just walk to into a room and there's on the other side of the one-way mirror is a is a subdivided two two cubes one with bobbin and one with alice in it but you've you've walked in and you don't have a model yet other than the fact that you're on the other side of the curtain you don't have a smiley face or a frowny face what you have is a moment where you have to ask if you're actively inferring and you're enacting this is what should i be surprised if and what should i not be surprised if as the as the as the stuff that's carrying out in bob's room somehow is appears to not being carried out in alice's room so i don't know that that modeling can can sort of segregate itself out scale free from the idea of of the specifics like pierce would say if you walked in and into a room and somebody opposite of you had a bunch of white beans in their left hand and a bag of beans in their right hand and asked you as the person walking to the room did these beans in this one hand come from this bag you wouldn't have enough information to be able to give a specific and clear answer to that but you could start a process of modeling you could start a modularity exercise to try and gather from an an abductive sense what what what led up to this moment and so i'm just kind of wondering how do you how how you take this paper and and that example and sort of tie it in with some of the other work that you've been because i i'm hoping maybe i'll talk to you after this but maybe i would like to be able to review your active inference and abduction paper as well if you have time anyway i'm just wondering what because i think if we're looking at this from active inference and enacting sometimes we walk in and we walk in and we have to infer based on a limited amount of information and so i think that's what we're trying to do we're basically saying when we walk in do or don't be surprised if and then whatever plays out approximately on the on those time scales next what do you agree with yes i do agree and uh well uh i'm very happy that you uh mentioned that paper because i wanted to speak about that too earlier so the thing is that as i say there are two phases of the same project so in this project i mean in the project that has been uh stated in this uh a tale of two architectures and in another paper a critical analysis of mark kobe and monism i was emphasizing the modal base modal relative nature of active inference as an activity uh but the main reason why i was getting interested in that because of the mark of blankets because i think that marco blankets are also very strong and uh reliable modeling tools also for the general scientific modeling purposes so it is the other side of my project when i'm trying to ground scientific realism and scientific model making in active inference and free energy principles so this is the other side and uh going back to the general arguments for uh scientific realism again a strong version of the defense of scientific realism uh is reliant on invoking uh infra explanatory inferences by developing something that is called uh inference to the best explanation and this project that you mentioned the paper that has been written by me and arty and there is another paper uh we were collaborating on another paper uh on the same subject aims to show that how the general explanatory inferences how the general abduction is grounded in the process of active inferences right so i think that there are two sides of the same coin and there are two intertwined two interrelated uh projects but uh as i say i do not see uh so do you want to also explore the uh implications what of that for the metaphor of bob and alice i mean do you think that it has any specific ramifications for this bob and alice metaphor yeah that's that was that's exactly what i think it does and again it's a separate paper and it's another excellent excellent insight if you if you get a chance to read it but i think when we're trying to figure out what's effective and functional we we come in to a situation looking at bob and alice and and over time our model grows as well right and i think that's part of where my question about what is what is scale free yes bob and alice are in their cubicles and those cubes are of the same dimensions and then there's a scale friendly part that kind of grows over those slices of time so yes i i actually do think that it would be interesting to sort of say when when did we walk in on this bob analysis observation very well so i would say that for the uh moderate weak sense of encapsulation that is at issue in this specific paper a tale of two city uh it would be the the necessary condition is that the information in each unit is not available to them to the person in the other unit or in the other black so uh to the extent that the information about for example bob brushing his teeth is not available to alice there is some sort of weak encapsulation and i think that it is you know for establishing some sort of uh moderate uh modulation but the other part the uh the more fundamental uh the more fundamental question about the uh scale relativity and to what extent so it is some sort of scientific fact that we can choose this scale that we need on the basis of our explanatory interests so at this specific setting my explanatory interest my scientific interest was to come to to set the limits of the scale at the level of the rooms of bob and alice because i wanted to explain encapsulation so in another situation so assume that you are an information theorist and you want to develop a general theory of communication between these two units so you it is natural for you to take the point of view of the third person of another observer and then there might be another person who wants to speak about the relation between this third person and the target system and a techno so it made it might go observer observer all the way up and observable uh all the way down and it would be a matter of uh what you are trying to do with changing the scale what what goal do you aim to achieve so again at some papers i i was trying to stay limited to the level of individual so for example when i wanted to model the activity of a scientist specifics an individual scientist i was focusing on the processes of minimization of uh predictive uh predictions at the level of individuals but at points i wanted to model the behavior or speak about the behavior of all scientific commodities assuming that scientific practice is a social act and i was for that reason i was trying to expand the limits of the scale and apply that to the old community of scientists or a specific group of scientists rather than individual scientists what was important for me and what i think is important is to have good and satisfactory justifications for changing the level to be able to explain clearly what was the purpose of changing the level taking it to an upper level or a lower level and i think that to the extent that we are speaking about encapsulation and modulation it is justifiable to limit the module to the specific cells in which bob and alice are dwelling so just wrote a few things down and maybe this captures it but the free energy principle especially as you're applying it in this um [Music] embodied informational and cognitive structural realism perspective the fep as a theory of things is providing the conceptual continuity for modeling different complex systems including scientists in the world and other processes as they engage in their niche and then the active inference uh framework we can say is operationalizing this imperative for persistence of different systems and then connecting that a priori process ontology to a whole host of other patterns motifs that we uh must explain in the world like abduction in the social and communication case and narrative information inference on one end of us but then on the other end we also want to have active really dial in and get at exact inference in certain cases where it's like we made the fmri measurements and we kind of want to like leave philosophy in the lab and just plug and chug this pipeline and we don't want that to be a pipeline of nowhere or um we don't want the output of the pipeline to be interpreted in a fallacious philosophical milieu but at the same time if we try to take that philosophical baggage through every step of the processor and the ram and the gpu we get into these little nano debates which you highlighted which is like people arguing whether cyclic or directed acyclic graphical models have philosophical impact when they're both just models that scientists chose for different reasons uh i have to say that you have the knock of explaining my ideas far more clearly than i can so here's my everybody majidi is a brilliant young man here's my next question for you because there's multiple fep um frontiers here you have the book then there's the markovian monism that we had earlier discussed the abduction one which we haven't gotten a chance to discuss this paper obviously so how do you keep the information organized or assess how new papers coming in play into how you want to develop these different threads of research or determine where you can be making an impact by targeting this paper or assessing this phenomena or stepping into this you know 5 000 year old philosophical debate well uh it is very hard to uh explain where these ideas are coming from i mean well i do not i mean if i could state the process in this fashion i most probably i would be able to hire someone to write a program that does this instead of doing that myself so uh i think that it is mainly a matter of intuition although it is it is very ironical because philosophically i'm not someone who uh escorts too much credit by the intuition so uh but i think that i have a general program as and as i said i'm trying to defend some sort of moderate version of cognitive realism that tries to account for scientific representation to grow scientific representation in uh in the relationship between uh set a commodity of self-organizing agents and their environment so i think that i'm starting from the uh uh from the uh simpler bits so for example starting by just stating the point that scientific representation could be grounded in free energy principle and then i'm just fleshing out the uh other complex issues so for example wanting so as they say one thing leads to another as soon as you try to account for scientific representation in terms of free energy principle uh people point out and there have been excellent papers by excellent criticism for example by uh uh max jones who were pointing out this criticism that science is not an individual activity it is a social activity and then i am going back to play showed the social aspects of my view so i think that it is again some sort of dynamical social uh process that leads to development of these ideas and then i'm trying to deal with this social aspect uh i stumble on reading thomas kuhn and i see that i have to also take care of theory lateness for example and i engage with that issue but i think that i started to work on these applying this model relativity the model based nature of scientific activity to philosophy of mind since 2016 and then as i say one thing led to another and i'm where i am now and i'm i have no idea what impact would this project lead to what group what group of people because most probably the project is a bit too scientific for philosophers and a bit too philosophical for scientists but uh well it is the only way that i know for developing my philosophical ideas awesome thank you blue if you wanted to raise your hand otherwise uh go for it if not and then uh okay blue then dave um so i think my comment was it's kind of old at this point but but really like i was just curious about um linking this or or under what circumstances or how can we apply this um the active inference framework to um partially encapsulated systems and so i mean i think that this is it gets into like i i guess that's the big question right so always just i would love to hear your thoughts on how information is passed from module to module or or what is this idea of mutual information um you know in the collective uh pan psychism sense like how do you think or to what degree is it shared and can you perhaps maybe shed some light on mathematically ways that you think it would make sense to talk about partial encapsulation uh well uh so starting from from the last part i think that mathematical representation is rather the easier part so we can easily model this partial encapsulation by invoking some sort of uh partial isomorphism so it is enough to have two sets of models and try to and try to show that to what extent or through what relation what parts what subparts of these sets are related to so to uh what subsets of the other system uh to the extent that there are significant chunks that are not related together through some sort of isomorphic relation we can retain some sort of partial isomorphism the other way i think that the more other more intuitive way of doing that is by invoking markov blankets i think that as a matter of fact i think that partial encapsulation is a direct uh results ramification of invoking markovian blankets because they are setting uh uh some sort of conditional independence between different chunks uh right so uh well uh from the very fact that there is some sort of partial encapsulation it doesn't follow that there is no uh amount of transfer of information between the tanks at all the only thing thing that is necessary for retaining this partial encapsulation is that at a given moment there is no actual so the only thing i think that the necessary condition and it is very minimal for retaining some sort of partial encapsulation is that at any given time information at one unit is not accessible to the observer in the other unit i think that this condition could be satisfied quite easily it is why i think that some sort of partial uh encapsulation endures despite the validity of kirchoff and hippolyta arguments thanks blue and then go ahead so so i guess this is um how how so so my my question was probably backwards so what about how is information shared not is how do you demonstrate information sharing as opposed to information encapsulates in encapsulation like if there's a markov blanket we establish conditional independence but like where can we establish conditional dependence or how can we establish conditional dependence that's the part that's that's really i'm curious about sorry all right it's very old so uh look uh the internal and external estates or the sensory and active states are related together but the thing is that the observer or if if you are encapsulated inside the markov blanket you can uh infer the properties of outside only indirectly so what i was trying to do to some extent is to instead of assuming that the cognitive system is cons is composed of markov blankets i try to put myself inside the marker blanket and see uh how could i get access to information that is outside the mark of blanket or inside other mark of blanket and to the extent that there is no direct relation or the information is not directly accessible at a given time i think that some sort of encapsulation endures it's like a cup half full cup half empty channel half open channel half closed it's the two extremes complete integration which maybe doesn't even make any sense like a solid-state drive i mean what would it even mean if all the information were connected to all the other information at the same time and just not compatible with the architectures of physical systems so interesting thought experiments though for total integration and then any realized system is either going to be fully conditionally independent entirely markov blanketed um [Music] or there'll be some partial relation and then part of the realism and instrumentalism okay that partial relation can be an edge like an effective or a functional connectivity edge which doesn't imply a causal role it's a scientific projection uh situationally defined edge that's being inferred in a specific statistics framework and then there are hidden states of the world of observers who are supposing causes like hypotheses about how things happen in the world and then they engage in all kinds of studies like loss of function gain of function blinded research those are protocols or affordances that scientists engage in to reduce their uncertainty about this hypothesis space so it's a very interesting area uh dave and then dean right um the perfect lead into what i was going to ask about the uh where you draw the boundaries where you draw the um the blankets is really important um i like to say nasty things about donald hoffman or or more specifically the way he allows himself to be portrayed is thinking that there's absolute freedom and throwing blankets wherever you want that the boundaries are totally arbitrary and so we are all one of the really though uh blanketing is a matter of where what's actually happening um are you majeed familiar about there we go are you familiar with mara beller's work on the level of actual scientific interaction can you describe that work a little bit mara bella yeah she was um for a number of years she was perhaps the leading historian of the early days of quantum mechanics and as she got more and more in depth into what actually was happening there are certain papers uh by boar that are widely as regarded as being totally incomprehensible you'd go from one thing that he's saying in the paper to a few sentences later and there doesn't seem to be any connection at all and people are thinking well what was he had he lost it was he too tired when he gave this talk well she went down and and trying to take sentence by sentence and phrase by phrase asking the same question that a good drama coach asks for each statement that you have to deliver what question is that speech an answer to and she found if you went through the people that that bore was in intimate dialogue with whether he was on their side or being driven crazy but like einstein if you kept that in mind and asked who is he talking to who was born talking to at each moment everything became very straightforward he was having a series of dialogues with a dozen people and just stringing one fragment of the dialogue after another and and i haven't read it yet but um that totally ties in with the concept of conversation theory which was something put together in the 1960s and 70s by my teacher of cybernetic learning theory gordon pask who defines the minimum unit of consciousness as the conversation and also represents each conversation or at least each enduring conversation as a psychological individual so you have very much nested markov blankets you have very much the leipnician hierarchy and the indefinitely large or infinitely large and deep hierarchy of minds composed of minds composed of minds and when the way beller presents that that's what science is about uh having lots of dialogues figuring out how they fit together the dialogues be getting new dialogues and uh in past sense those conversations themselves in the best case become the enduring individuals maybe the immortal individuals that make up a successful living science well yeah thank you very much for uh the input yeah i agree that the the issue of choosing the scale is not arbitrary so i think that earlier in the paper i refer to the works of rodolf carnap and thomas kuhn to point out that i think that there should be some general considerations that rule over the choice of a specific scale this is partly determined by the property of the target system itself and partly by the interest of the modeler depending on what the model is trying to work out about the target system so i completely agree with that and evolves the collaborative and uh distributes it so uh i don't know whether it is i'm reading too much onto what you said right but into what you said right now but uh i'm completely on board the uh some sort of collective uh distributed take on scientific activity and this is something that i have been defending in recent papers in the previous year so uh i completely agree with that and uh well uh my so the point about in individuals and how to define an individual or the borders of consciousness the limits of consciousness is still uh very much at the center of my uh my intellectual interpre enterprises so this is something that i'm trying to explore more so and this is something that i'm thinking about these days whether the unit of scientific activity is especially a region in the popular a population of neurons in the brain of a scientist or an individual scientist or a group of scientists so these are all very interesting topics thank you very much thanks for the response so dean and then blue shield i think what you've done is you've hit on a really important point and that is that whenever we do isomorphism we can sort of take an iso an isovis stance i've read a book a long time ago by uh the editor author was james brockwell it was it was called um uh the visual world and memory and what he said was is that the way that we capture uh can be one of two types the eyes of this stance that sort of isomorphism that we're outside and we're creating a representation with frames around them or we can be spatially enveloped which kind of ties in really conveniently with the idea of being either in the cubbyhole that bob is in or alice is in or anybody that's within spatially enveloped within that sort of entailed world where we're sort of now the subject of whatever the walls are limiting us from being able to see and so i don't think we walk away from the idea that we can make models we just have to be able to ask on a moment especially to to blues point how do we how do we make something available as opposed to keeping it sort of cleaved off or or sectioned off we have to kind of take the perspective or the view of the person who's enveloped who doesn't necessarily have that isovist slash model ability to nest thing and look at the world from their eyes which is okay it's not what you're seeing necessarily in terms of what's on the page it's how you're entering the room with maybe not as much background and not as much ability to step outside of all of this information and start juggling and so i think that is one of the really key points to try to remember here when we model that just because i have a model that i can take that eyes of his stance doesn't mean i am able to also remember what it was like to be the one sort of captured or enveloped by less information but still trying to catch up i think if we can hold both up at once it's back to that minimum two things at once don't be surprised if do be surprised if or active and inference like i think i think what we're what we're really basically saying here is bumping it up by including two things that sort of depth perception piece yes it does make it more complicated or complex but that doesn't mean it's it's overwhelming it gets overwhelming if you try to do i guess maybe seven or ten dimensions at once but we can bump up to two we can take the eyes of his stance we can do the model and we can also be remember what it was like to be spatially enveloped you're gonna get overwhelmed and surprised by the real world when the train comes at you if you don't have depth perception so it's a very interesting take dean like yes two and two is truer than one but also there's other benefits too blue so just to kind of clarify like what i was talking about earlier and then add on to what dave was saying like i i want to know how to draw a partial marsh markov blanket like how do how do you like like to me a markov blanket like represents a distinct boundary between like self and other internal and external and so how do you make this kind of partial markov blanket and i like what dave was saying or about what um his teacher put forward about the conversation being a unit of consciousness and i am very much a ascriber to pan psychism like i i don't think that it necessarily needs to be a conversation between two humans um but but really maybe fundamentally each relationship between two objects perhaps each relationship has then its own markov blanket like you know my heart and my liver have a relationship with each other that that itself is encapsulated with a markov blanket and this can you know be attributed to any two cells or two organisms or so on and so forth uh very well so by the way of uh an example i completely agree so uh especially about the part that this uh so uh uh well i do not want to use the term conversation because i do not know the theoretical implications very well but uh i think that so uh i used this when i started this project for example on modeling scientific activity as some sort of active inference i was thinking of individual scientists as the units of uh scientific activity so science an individual scientist has been enveloped by markov blanket and she was trying to get an access to the causal structure of the world by forming influences from beyond the blanket but as i worked more on this aspect i understood that the situation is becoming complex uh very quickly so uh then i just uh then i thought that we could put all of the scientific group or scientific community inside the mark of blanket and then try to explain their relation with the environment as uh the parts of a general markov blanket by just expanding the scale that includes them and then at the stage i also told that we could also moder in the same way that we could envelop the relation between uh two scientists inside the markov blanket we could just expand that and also include the artifact the object the major the scientific uh experimental tools inside the community of the scientists so scientific activity is basically about the relation between scientists scientists human human activity and human artifact uh relationship and scientific activities distributed to all of this group which includes both human beings and artifacts and then like depending on your take on uh free energy principle whether you are defending a representation of this stance or an activist stance you can speak about the relation of this group to their environment in terms of classical representation or coupling or a hybrid view which includes both representations and coupling thank you very interesting makes me think about science and technology and how the word science relates to like a lot of inference and psi and scry and all that and then technology technique and that has a little bit more of the implications of tool deployment and finesse and measurement and the blurry line between science and technology and the who and the what and the how so it's very cool let's um in our last little bit here first if anybody watching live has questions we totally can address them but this was the question that we left off on at the end of the 0.1 video which was how do you utilize functional and effective connectivity in active inference analysis to better inform an answer to a question such as in football why i scored the goal so how does that enrich in analysis because we've talked a lot about how the chosen models deployed by scientists are goal driven and so what exactly is active inference helping us do or how is it enriching our account of a situation like scoring a goal in a sports ball game well as a philosopher i feel that i have to stay silent about this question to avoid revealing my deep ignorance of the technical aspects of how this works so i i mean i have some general ideas and i can try but i think that it would be better to stay silent and not reveal my ignorance how about start it off with something ignorant and then we'll see if any other researchers have thoughts well uh i do not know about this specific example but for me the distinction between functional connectivity and effective connectivity was about the our causal physical aspects of the target system and the general global and structural features of the system so i was not thinking of this in terms of so the point that i was trying to make whether to try to focus on modeling the causal physical aspects or focus on the structure or global aspect would be a matter of the interest of the scientists or the modeler whether at the moment or whether in order to do the task at hand she prefers to stay focused on the general aspect speaking about the relation between different parts in unifying structural terms or going into the details and trying to model local specific uh features i'm not quite sure how i can apply that to the the example of scoring a goal dean or anyone else i just think it's in scoring the goal again pre pre-kicking the ball you could be asking yourself two questions why am i surprised about the result or should i be surprised about the result because i think that's what active inference affords it gives you that it gives you that possibility of two outcomes i scored a goal or i kicked it up into the stands but before you actually kick the ball perhaps perhaps if you're not really really skilled at kicking a ball you can ask yourself whether or not there's enough enough in this particular case mechanical familiarity and background to actually finish off what you intended to do that's what i think active inference allows for but again my ignorance shines through too so okay i'll give a thought so i think there's active inference and then there's functional and effective connectivity because functional effective connectivity have gone back further so first applying the techniques of functional effective connectivity help us separate out hypotheses about physical causal mechanisms from a whole variety of different kinds of edges that might be uh applied like there's time correlation there's mutual information there's um change with respect to like you know condition on this one going up in that split second this one goes up as well so all kinds of different uh edges that can be drawn essentially in a graphical framework so not just like visual but on a nodes and edges active inference gives us a i mean among other things so this of course would not be a complete or authoritative answer but it does provide us with a a framework and a nexus and a community that can scaffold and nurture accounts of the target phenomena so kicking a goal we want to have the biomechanics researcher and the force on the knee and physical rehab and then also there's an easy way to go into like the um social inter-subjectivity of the game rules and regimes of attention and thinking through other teammates and um [Music] cyber physical systems of the soccer stadium and then like reviewer two just addressing the inner or outer critic and knowing that we don't need to to have a theory of everything to talk about the ball being kicked so i'd say that actin specifically provides um value for the researcher the the goal scoring researcher because it will help them reduce their uncertainty about what contribution to make to the research literature by just saying like giving really good connection points if they're doing the biomechanics paper it can have awesome connection points to the cultural and the social and all of that and if they're doing the social paper it could have nice articulation with the biomechanics and that would even be before we get into the um some of the details of the active modeling per se um so if anyone in the live chat would like any final questions otherwise we will sort of cruise out you know in the dot zero we do the background and it's the time that we all need to take to like work through these very provocative and interesting and far-reaching papers then dot one is a lot of times like a mess because we're exploring a lot of different avenues and we never finished them all in the dot 2 but this is sort of where we take off into our next set of discussions it happens to be that in the coming weeks we're going to be talking about the nature of self representation so that might have some themes but majeed i'm just curious like what are you excited about for 2022 what um directions or policies are like exciting to you now that you've very recently completed this work well uh uh i'm uh excited about a new book that is under review and it's true so uh a structural realism as i said was the the officialism of philosophy of science for quite a while and uh i tried to develop a cognitive version of a structural realism before no in a new book that is in a new book that is going to be published it is not i mean it is a sequel to the book that you are seeing in a new book that is under review right now i'm going to play show the social aspects of scientific activity so a structural realist despite all of their virtues they were not too much attending speaking about the social aspects of science and i think that that aspect has has been to some extent neglected in the contemporary philosophy of science so it has it had its high day in works of thomas kuhn and fireband and then it has been pushed into the background and now i'm building up on free energy principle so the theories of social communication that are grounded in free energy principle to bring back the uh uh this discourse on uh social aspects of scientific activity so the book that is under review is the title is aptly called uh bringing social awareness to a structural realism so i'm very excited about that i still do not know whether it will pass the review and whether it will go to the press or not but i'm very much excited about that nice um reminds me of bruno latour reassembling the social of course different aim but that almost feels invoked in the title well uh well it is a different aim but as i say uh it has so it is mainly about works of thomas kuhn and fireman but it also has references to the works of social constructivist la tour and others and specifically uh sorry i have to change the place to put my laptop into the charge again but uh the thing is that uh lotto was one of the main people who was complaining about this kind of uh dismissiveness of social aspects of scientific activity and i think that people who were working in distributed cognition were trying to they're actually explicitly mentioning works of lottery and some other social cognitives to uh find a foothold for bring for creating cognition or knowledge as some sort of distributed social activity uh so uh what i try to do is to develop some sort of elective distributed account of uh scientific cognition this has been something that people such as ronald geary have been doing before and no uh non-synergy and some other people are doing these things but what i was trying to do is to try to reinforce and reconstruct this uh very interesting insights by drawing on recent development in free energy principle so some sort of free energy principle account of social communication i'm building upon that to reconstruct uh classical accounts of distributed scientific cognition which as well has its roots in works of latter and some other social cognition social constructivists so you were very sharp to spot the relation again cool nice um [Music] connection there looking forward to that like actor network theory ant distributed systems kind of makes sense um well i think if anyone else wants to give a final thought or comment anyone other than the author then we'll provide the last word to the author so blue and then either dave or dean this is a lot of like fun thought experiments and um just thanks for your time and as any good paper opens more questions than provides answers i think so i'm curious to see what your next work is and how it all unfolds in the future thank you very much for for your contribution as well uh dean and then dave if you would like majida as as i mentioned earlier i hope that uh if if in a couple months time and there's a slot where you have some availability i would like to also look at that um [Music] this work that you've done around abduction and the idea of active inference as well because i think in terms of trying to be able to cast a wider net and get a better sense of how we model and look at things through through time frames both before during and after i think that would be something that i'd like to take up because going through this paper certainly um [Music] brought a lot of things to the forum was really really helpful so thank you very much thank you for showing up today was really appreciated no so thank you very much for your interest so i learned quite a lot too both from participating today and from watching the video the the previous video of the discussions great well yep as always super fun to read and to interact with you to take it from a epistemic stigmargy interaction with your asynchronous artifact into something that is spatially remote but still interactive hashtag effective connectivity um so just keep in contact with us and anytime you would like to discuss more or do anything else with the lab just be in touch and anyone else as well so great times thank you everybody thank you very much uh and sorry for being a bit busy after teaching and this end of the semester hassle so thank you very much take care excellent see you all later you
