# IDEAS

- The active inference lab focuses on team communication, learning, and practice related to active inference.
- Feedback is encouraged to improve the active inference lab's work and presentations.
- The neural correlates of consciousness are discussed under the free energy principle.
- The presentation is part of a series, with follow-up discussions planned on the same paper.
- Philosophy in the Mind Sciences is an open-access journal founded to explore intersections of philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology.
- The concept of neural correlates of consciousness was introduced by David Chalmers in 2000.
- Challenges exist in applying the free energy principle to consciousness research, as it is not a theory of consciousness itself.
- A shift from neural correlates to computational correlates of consciousness is suggested in the paper.
- The paper proposes that computational correlates could provide insights into consciousness and its mechanisms.
- Complexity and its measurement are significant in understanding consciousness and neural activity.
- The paper discusses the challenges of unusual conditions affecting neural correlates of consciousness, such as brain damage.
- Potential cases of islands of awareness question whether consciousness can exist without sensory input or motor output.
- The free energy principle may not apply well to systems isolated from their environment.
- Computational explanations of consciousness must differentiate between simulating and instantiating consciousness.
- Consciousness may involve an action-perception loop where internal states interact with external states.
- The paper suggests a need for understanding complexity in the context of consciousness and the free energy principle.
- Minimal unifying models of consciousness could bridge gaps between different theories and aspects of consciousness.
- Consciousness may facilitate clusters of cognitive abilities, requiring empirical investigation to support hypotheses.
- The paper emphasizes the importance of developing operational definitions and criteria for consciousness across different systems.
- Non-human animals and artificial systems may possess consciousness, necessitating criteria for assessment.
- The distinction between conscious systems and simulations of consciousness is crucial for ethical considerations in technology and research.
- Dynamic and contextual factors influence the nature of consciousness and its operationalization in different beings and systems.
