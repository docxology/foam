# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The livestream discusses the paper on communication as socially extended active inference, exploring ecological perspectives and implications for communicative behavior.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The Active Inference Institute promotes participatory learning in active inference applications.
2. Communication is framed as socially extended active inference to influence behavior.
3. The paper contrasts traditional transmission views with ecological perspectives on communication.
4. Pragmatism emphasizes communication as action rather than mere information transmission.
5. Active inference links communicative behavior to biological imperatives of minimizing free energy.
6. The authors describe communication's role in shaping affordances and joint actions.
7. The ecological interpretation highlights how organisms influence each other's behavior.
8. Key themes include cooperation, aggression, and alarm signaling as communication forms.
9. Neuroimaging data supports ecological interpretations of communicative behaviors and joint attention.
10. The conclusion suggests future directions for research on communication as an ecological practice.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Communication should be understood through ecological frameworks rather than just information transmission.
2. Active inference provides a biological grounding for understanding communicative behavior.
3. Pragmatism allows for experimental approaches to studying communication's action-oriented nature.
4. Future research should explore how communication shapes and is shaped by social environments.
5. The interplay between transmission and ecological views enriches our understanding of communication dynamics.
