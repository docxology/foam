# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion explores quantum reference frames, the non-fungibility of information, and the relationship between complexity, observation, and communication.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Session three discusses quantum reference frames and the implications for information processing.
2. Lecture two introduced the concept of information processing through qubits and reference frames.
3. Non-fungibility of quantum information contrasts with classical fungible information like zeros and ones.
4. Reference frames are essential for understanding depth and context in quantum information.
5. The relationship between measurement, preparation, and cognitive processes is explored in quantum systems.
6. Complexity arises from the tension between entanglement and separability in quantum systems.
7. Communication channels and the role of attention in processing information are emphasized.
8. Theories suggest that space emerges from communication, challenging classical physics notions.
9. Understanding quantum systems involves recognizing the topological nature of information and boundaries.
10. Future sessions will delve deeper into how agents utilize multiple communication channels.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Quantum information is non-fungible, requiring physical embodiment for transmission.
2. Reference frames impact perception and understanding in quantum systems.
3. Complexity in cognition relates to the balance of entanglement and separability.
4. Communication channels are integral to cognitive processing and information sharing.
5. The emergence of space from communication is a key concept in quantum physics.
