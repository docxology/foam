# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Institute's cohort 7 discusses chapter 6, emphasizing modeling active inference agents and environments through generative models.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Cohort 7 begins with chapter 6 of the active inference textbook.
2. The first half focused on fundamentals; the second half emphasizes modeling.
3. Active inference explores how agents update beliefs and make decisions.
4. Generative models represent the problem the brain is trying to solve.
5. The chapter presents a four-step recipe for designing active inference models.
6. Understanding Markov blankets helps define systems of interest for modeling.
7. Agents perform actions that influence the environment and receive observations.
8. Active inference addresses cognitive modeling issues not fully captured by reinforcement learning.
9. The generative model describes the agentâ€™s beliefs, while the generative process represents the environment.
10. Chapter 6 serves as a practical guide for cognitive modeling applications.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Familiarize yourself with the concepts of generative models and Markov blankets.
2. Engage with the open science environment to enhance understanding of active inference.
3. Explore the relationship between cognitive modeling and various disciplines.
4. Utilize the textbook as a foundational resource for active inference concepts.
5. Participate in discussions and contribute questions to deepen your learning experience.
