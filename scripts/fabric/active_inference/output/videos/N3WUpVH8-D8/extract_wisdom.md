# SUMMARY
Daniel and Blue discuss Matthew Sims' paper on symbiosis, cognition, and the free energy principle, exploring biological minds and multi-scale integration.

# IDEAS:
- The paper explores intelligence scaling from subcellular to ecosystem levels, integrating active inference perspectives.
- It connects philosophy of biology to the natural history of specific species for deeper understanding.
- Reciprocal multi-scale integration suggests that systems use each other to refine their models of reality.
- The symbiosis of Vibrio fischeri bacteria and bobtail squid illustrates cognitive integration and ecological relationships.
- Cognitive evolution involves transitions from solitary to group intentionality, impacting biological individuals' definitions.
- The notion of physiological individuals helps understand symbiotic relationships and major evolutionary transitions.
- Bioluminescence in squid demonstrates cognitive emergence from the interaction of distinct biological systems.
- Understanding cognition requires rethinking traditional definitions of biological individuals in evolutionary contexts.
- Active inference models may describe how living systems resist thermodynamic equilibrium via adaptive behaviors.
- The relationship between organisms and their environments influences cognitive capabilities and individuality perceptions.
- Multi-scale integration shows how cognitive systems can have varying boundaries, impacting their functional dynamics.
- Individuality can be conceptualized as a continuum rather than a binary distinction, reflecting complex interactions.
- The paper highlights the importance of feedback loops in distinguishing cognitive systems from non-cognitive entities.
- Cognitive systems must possess a high degree of autonomy to be classified as cognizers.
- The vibrio-squid relationship exemplifies how mutualism can lead to emergent properties in biological systems.
- Philosophical implications of symbiotic minds challenge traditional views of individuality and cognition in biology.

# INSIGHTS:
- Biological minds can be understood through reciprocal multi-scale integration and the free energy principle.
- The evolution of cognition involves significant transitions that redefine our understanding of individual and collective intelligence.
- Symbiotic relationships can create novel cognitive entities, challenging established definitions of biological individuality.
- Individuality is best viewed as a spectrum, influenced by ecological interactions and evolutionary history.
- The interplay between organisms and their environments shapes cognitive development and adaptability in living systems.
- Understanding cognition requires integrating physiological, functional, and informational perspectives on individuality.
- Active inference can clarify how living systems navigate their environments while maintaining structural integrity.
- Feedback mechanisms are crucial for defining the boundaries of cognitive systems and their emergent properties.
- The relationship between cognition and symbiosis illustrates the interconnectedness of life forms and their environments.
- Cognitive evolution is a dynamic process shaped by the interactions and adaptations of biological systems.

# QUOTES:
- "This paper will develop and deploy the notion of reciprocal multi-scale integration from within the free energy principle."
- "The notion of a physiological individual has been developed to understand symbiosis."
- "This paper contributes to a more complete understanding of the evolution of cognition."
- "The vibrio squid assemblage constitutes a functionally integrated cognitive whole."
- "The reason why the notion of ontologically nested cognizers may be unintuitive stems from our folk psychology."
- "There are many major transitions in evolution from multi-organismality to multicellularity."
- "The relationship between the organism and its environment is key to understanding individuality."
- "Active inference describes how living systems resist the second law of thermodynamics."
- "Cognition emerges when parts interact in a wider whole, resulting in properties that the parts do not possess alone."
- "Physiological individuals can be more or less symbiotic over time, reflecting a continuum."
- "What produces bioluminescence—the squid, the bacteria, or their assemblage—challenges our definitions of individuality."
- "The distinction between adaptive and mere active inference is crucial for understanding cognition."
- "Our understanding of biology influences our conception of cognition and individuality."
- "The vibrio-squid system exemplifies the emergence of novel properties through symbiotic relationships."
- "Cognitive evolution involves significant shifts that redefine intentionality in living systems."
