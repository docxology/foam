# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Active inference explores symbiosis and cognition through the lens of the free energy principle, highlighting multi-scale integration in biological minds.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The active inference lab discusses a paper on biological minds and symbiosis.
2. The paper examines the symbiosis of Vibrio fischeri bacteria and bobtail squid.
3. It argues for the concept of reciprocal multi-scale integration in cognitive systems.
4. Symbiotic individuals represent a continuum of physiological individuality in evolution.
5. The Markov blanket formalism helps understand cognitive boundaries of interacting systems.
6. Distinctions between adaptive and mere active inference are crucial for understanding cognition.
7. The interaction between squid and bacteria demonstrates emergent properties of symbiotic systems.
8. Philosophical implications arise from questioning the nature of biological minds.
9. The paper emphasizes a need to rethink traditional views on cognition and individuality.
10. Multi-scale integration challenges conventional understandings of individual organisms and their environments.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Symbiosis can redefine our understanding of individuality and cognition in biological systems.
2. The free energy principle provides a framework for examining cognitive processes across scales.
3. Reciprocal interactions between species can lead to emergent cognitive properties.
4. Rethinking folk psychological concepts is essential for grasping biological complexities.
5. The squid and bacteria symbiosis exemplifies the dynamic nature of evolutionary cognition.
