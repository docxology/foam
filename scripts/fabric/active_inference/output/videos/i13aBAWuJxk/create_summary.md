# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Lab discusses the neural and computational correlates of consciousness through the lens of the free energy principle.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Lab explores online communication about consciousness and the free energy principle.
2. The discussion centers on a paper by Wanja Whis and Carl Friston about consciousness.
3. Neural correlates of consciousness must focus on dynamics rather than static states.
4. Computational correlates should be defined by probabilities encoded in neural states.
5. The free energy principle can aid in explaining consciousness and its computational correlates.
6. The paper addresses how consciousness might exist without sensory input or behavior.
7. Active inference distinguishes between conscious systems and mere simulations of consciousness.
8. Lempel-Ziv complexity serves as a measure of dynamical complexity in consciousness research.
9. The discussion emphasizes the need for empirical validation of measures relating to consciousness.
10. A Markov blanket framework helps partition sensory and action states in active systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding consciousness requires integrating neural and computational perspectives.
2. The free energy principle offers a promising framework for studying consciousness.
3. Complexity measures like Lempel-Ziv help quantify dynamical properties of conscious systems.
4. Empirical validation is crucial for establishing reliable measures of consciousness.
5. Distinguishing between conscious experience and simulation is essential for accurate research outcomes.
