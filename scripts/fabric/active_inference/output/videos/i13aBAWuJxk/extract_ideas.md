# IDEAS

- Active inference lab focuses on online team communication and learning related to active inference.
- The upcoming discussions will revolve around the paper on neural correlates of consciousness.
- The free energy principle (FEP) is not a singular theory but supports consciousness research.
- Neural correlates of consciousness should be defined in terms of neural dynamics rather than states.
- Research on computational correlates of consciousness should complement neural correlates for better understanding.
- The paper aims to explore how neural correlates can explain consciousness through FEP.
- Computational correlates of consciousness (CCCs) relate to probabilities encoded by neural states.
- FEP provides a framework for understanding consciousness beyond traditional definitions.
- The concepts of easy, medium, and hard problems of consciousness are discussed in relation to FEP.
- The dynamics of consciousness can occur even without sensory stimulation or behavior.
- Consciousness may exist in systems that simulate conscious behavior without being conscious themselves.
- The relationship between consciousness and sensory input is complex and multi-faceted.
- Active inference involves modeling internal states and external interactions through Bayesian statistics.
- The Markov blanket serves as a critical concept for understanding the interactions of systems.
- Measuring consciousness involves understanding both neural dynamics and computational processes.
- The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity measure relates to the repetitiveness of sequences in consciousness studies.
- Dynamical complexity is essential for understanding the behavior of complex adaptive systems.
- Conscious systems may maximize LZ complexity while minimizing algorithmic complexity.
- Simulation of consciousness differs fundamentally from actual conscious experience.
- Reservoir computing provides a new perspective on computation within complex systems. 
- The integration of various approaches can enhance our understanding of consciousness and its correlates. 
- There is a continuous need for empirical validation of measures related to consciousness and complexity.
