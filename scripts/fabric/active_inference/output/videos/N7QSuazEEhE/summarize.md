# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion explores code implementations for direct policy inference in active inference, focusing on model specifications and message passing.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The session involves code explorations related to message passing papers.
2. Direct policy inference is highlighted as a novel approach in active inference.
3. The implementation is done in Julia, and the code is publicly available.
4. The transition mixture model facilitates policy differences in the experiments.
5. The agent operates in a maze, seeking rewards based on observations.
6. The model employs goal observation nodes for goal-constrained message passing.
7. Point mass constraints enforce deterministic decision-making in the agent's actions.
8. The discussion emphasizes the importance of clear model specification and constraints.
9. Backward message passing allows for efficient inference without exhaustive search trees.
10. The paper aims to provide accessible tools for researchers in active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
