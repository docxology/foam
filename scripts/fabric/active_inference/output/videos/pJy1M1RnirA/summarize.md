# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The meeting discussed chapter one of an active inference textbook, emphasizing key concepts like high/low roads, surprise minimization, and salience.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The meeting focused on discussing chapter one of the active inference textbook.
2. Participants explored questions about high road and low road distinctions in active inference.
3. Active inference involves minimizing surprise through sensory observations in uncertain environments.
4. The concept of salience relates to observations that effectively reduce uncertainty.
5. Participants shared insights on the distinction between mind and brain in active inference.
6. The high road perspective addresses normative aspects of minimizing surprise and free energy.
7. Vicarious minimization of surprise uses proxies like variational free energy.
8. Learning and perception may unfold as similar processes over different timescales.
9. The session encouraged collaboration and contributions to ongoing discussions and questions.
10. Future meetings will address mathematical appendices related to active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference integrates perception, cognition, and action without distinct modules.
2. Understanding salience is crucial for reducing uncertainty in active inference.
3. Participants are encouraged to collaborate and contribute to shared knowledge.
4. The relationship between mind and brain is a key topic in active inference.
5. Learning can be scaffolded through perception, highlighting their interconnectedness.
