hello and welcome this is actm math stream 6 on August 2nd 2024 to you shanana hi everyone thank you for having us Daniel we are excited for our stream today we are starting a new chapter in our math art conversations today we're going to be talking about Harry Potter most specifically dementor anim Magus and episodic memory as an inference exploration of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of aaban so since we're talking about Dementors today we might need a little protection I'm scared so that we have a little wizard in the house this is one of the most difficult and Powerful charms there are un many Wizards and witches cannot produce it to C to cast the charm you have to think of a very powerful positive memory and pronouns expecto patronum when done properly the one produce a misty white stuff that adopts the form of an animal with a special meaning to spell C this animal acts as a shield protecting the wizard or the witch from the demous influence I'm going to show you expect okay thanks Matias thanks for your protection okay I think we are safe to start with the scientific part now as you could see casting the charm to someone aaton relies heavily on episodic memory we're going to describe episodic memory in detail but in the book when they describe this dementor they say get TOA a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sacked out of you and this happy memory that you have to invoke or retrieve from your memory to cast this spell is what a shield and we are going to talk a bit about memory and then we will specify what epis memories so at a general distinction I'm taking borrowing from lar Square we can talk of two big types of memory declarative memory and non declarative memory when we talk of declarative memory often people refers to it also as explicit memory and when we say we have declarative memory is some information we have a store that can be put into WS so if you ask me for instance whether I know the formula for water I will tell you that water is make up of hydrogen and oxygen and this makes it declarative I can show you with words that I do in fact have that information in my brain now if we talk of non declarative memory these are informations that I cannot express in words I cannot prove for instance I can play record of de la lra which is a piece guitar piece from Francisco Tara I canot prove it to you unless I take a guitar and I play it and then you can see that that information was indeed stored in my memory so whenever we talk of non declarative types of memory we can show we have that information stored by acting so there is some kind of motoric activity involved now if we come back to the declarative or explicit memory we can have a stored information for facts and for events information for facts is lacking any context for instance I couldn't remember when I learned that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen I couldn't retrieve information like who was there when I acquired that information who was the teacher was in was I in a classroom what the emotion was I was I experiencing at that time none of these details had remained in my memory and that makes it semantic memory or memory factual memory memory for facts if I could retrieve all this contextual information like I was visiting that memory again and relieving it then we would be talking of episodic memory so let's go to describe or Define more specifically what episodic memory is what is the kind of memory that is used in the patronos charm endel toing to of episodic recall as involving the ability to mentally time travel to relief a specific events and here we need a capacity to have sense of self sense of subjective time and autonomic awareness and this Aon auton atic awareness sorry is conscious awareness that this happen to us at a specific P time so we know that this is something personal we live that experience that makes it makes episodic so Central to episodic recall it's not just knowing the what it's not just having that information is being able to project ourself to that specific moment in that that information was acquired so knowing where it happened knowing when it happened is important and is essential to to of episodic recall and also being acutely aware that this is something that happened to us and I'm going to put another example to make it very clear I can tell you about the day which is the day that the Allies launched a battle in the coast of Normandy in France and was a decisive battle to defeat adult Fila so I know this information this for me is factual information it's semantic information it is not episodic because I never was there I learn it from books now if we were to ask a soldier that was there that very day his recall would be completely different he would project himself to that scenario to that specific moment in time he would probably relieve the smell of gunpowder he would remember the sound of bombing and he would probably have some kind of fysical reaction related to fear he would relieve part of that emotional trauma and that would make it a epic memory so one essential part when we talk of episodic recall is this ability to project ourself to a specific moment in times and this could be the past normally when we talk of episod in memory we refer to project ourself to specific moments of our past but it might also we might also be talking of projecting myself to the Future so I can also send myself to the Future for instance last week when the live stream ended I could be projecting myself to this very live stream and anticipating what was going to happen today would I be anxious would I be okay how will I perform so these things I can do also I can project myself to a specific moment in times and this requires executive control and this for me is a very essential aspect too we are able to project ourselves to specific moments in time because we have high executive control over our memories or the contents of our memories and the last thing I would like to say about the eping memory is that I believe it is Preparatory so it's not just to Remish of the past but to prepare ourself better better for what is to come and I'm going to put you another example if I faced um danger in my past there was a threat and I could survive it is useful that I relieve that experience because some details of that experience could help me face similar situations in the future so being able to relieve those experiences even the emotional part might help me prepare better for what is to come and that is why I think that episodic memory might have adapted or selected because it has this Preparatory aspect and now now we are going to uh talk a bit more about semantic versus episodic memory semantic is what before in the figure that I showed uh was memory for facts is lacking the context I'm not relieving one experience and there is a fact that is very interesting that serma coin as semantization of memory that happens when an episodic memory as time goes by gets more his light in essence becomes semantic memory and I'm going to put you the example of water again now for me the formula water it is semantic information semantic memory because I lack any context I cannot remember when I learned that which year was that who was in my classroom at that time how I was feeling emotionally so I cannot Rel leave that episode of my life now if I were a able to travel in time and place myself one week after I learned that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen The Experience would be very different and probably this would be an episod in memory because I would be able to retrieve details of that episode I would be able to project myself to that very moment that I learned that information I could tell you who was the teacher I could tell you who was with me I could tell you whether I was anxious at that moment because I had a test next day or I was happy for some other reason so I I would be relieving the experience but 30 years or more later all those contextual dets details have disappeared they are not longer in my memory so now that very memory that was episodic at that time now has become semantic memory and that is an interesting fact of how this memories mutate in time another fact that is interesting is how whenever we relieve one of these episodic events we might add new information this is not something we do in purpose it's not a a dramatic change but we know that memory is not something that does not change so when we relieve one of those episodic memories we might inadvertently and without wanting it introduce little details that were not there when we store that information and more importantly is whenever we edit one of these memory traces episodic memories whatever thing we add there will stay unless when we reactivate it again we inadvertently remove that information so that means that every time we reopen or relieve one of these episodic memories we might be kind of updating that memory and in the process we might be introducing things that are not not that didn't actually happened and this is especially relevant when we talk of court and Witnesses because this is something we need to to be careful not to introduce information that is not actual that is not real and now Shana I think you can take thank you for that great explanation Hector the like episodic versus semantic we're going to get into that more in a few more case examples everyone and I have a few questions for Hector later so just to sort of give some context to the Dementors in case people um aren't aware Dementors actually take the form of what's called wraithlike creatures meaning sort of spectral which locomote actually by gliding and the ministry of magic has a very peculiar classification of these they're actually what is called non-being and they're called non-human spirus apparitions what I find really neat is that so Dementors are quote not truly alive and they're actually invisible to Muggles which are called the the non magic people so as um what's you know kind of makes them kind of sickly is that they operate by feeding on positive feelings Associated to episodic events and so they leave behind really just only the foulest of memories so a little bit of history is that the Dementors are employed by the ministry of magic to guard the inmates in the prison of aaban until about 1996 and then um they start forming an allegiance to Lord Voldemort and then so they're they no longer become guards of of aaban with this Allegiance switch so there's one defense against the Dementors which is the petronis charm and we want to say thank you Matias for protecting us at the beginning of the stream okay so Ramos Lupin the professor who turns into a werewolf um which is sort of not not not very fun has a description of the Dementors that I think I would like to just sort of share so he says Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this Earth so they um they literally infest the darkest filthiest places they glory and Decay and despair they drain Peace Hope and happiness out of the air around them go too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you um so if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself soulless and evil you'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and you will just be an empty shell that lost its Soul so we know that these are coming from a very deep space in JK and I really commender for making a shape take this form that we can all relate with and so um a feature that I find quite peculiar is that Dementors are what are called Immortal so in contrast to Mortal or Immortal so immortality is that the Dementors were never alive to begin with and they never have actually truly died so they're unable to die versus an immortal creature that's actually a living creature that's unable to actually die so the second feature of Dementors that makes them you know pretty scary is that they have this sort of consumptive um action that's called the dementor kiss and it's very terrifying so when the dementor consumes you this way it's its form of attack it leaves one living yet without a self memories or emotions so a soul could actually be trapped within the dementor sort of like it's a black wol sucking the life out of the sun next to it and if you lose yourself we claim that you actually you lose memory and then you lose a narrative time and that's the time that you can can actually construct a personhood with a historicity Shan is here today to talk to you because of XYZ and so we are really going to dive into this like if you lost your memory do you actually have a narrative time and what what state is your personhood so the dementor actually feeding off of that is quite terrifying and I have a really interesting question is that you know Harry seems to be particularly vulnerable to Dementors Hector and nearly almost passes out faints and um is you know very susceptible to their power and so you know it must have something to do with episodic memory and so can you please maybe um share some insight on why you think Harry is particularly vulnerable to the DeMent yes thank you Shana that's a very good question and it is hinted uh in the book that is because of his traumatic past but I think we can offer a more scientific EXP explanation that has to do with this episod in memory because episodic memory are things that you have lived personally and in the case of Harry Potter he has very traumatic event in his life like he witness how how Lord Voldemort killed his parents and he has been fighting a basilisk in in previous years at Hogwart he has faced life and death situation and this is something that is not common for a child his age so he has these terrible episodic memories that live with other joyful episodic memories and I guess that when dd Mentor is sucking out the good memories he's left with terrible memories and this is something that wouldn't happen without kids that don't have these terrible memories that they are left with so I think that would explain that he's so sensitive to the effect of gentos but this is my interpretation from the perspective of memory of course I like that yeah and everyone so we're just offering our own interpretations here this is just um a three like just a three-person chat talking about what we think is actually happening here to be respectful of fandom um awesome so I think a lovely way to sort of picture this is to try to do some sort of illustration of the power of Dementors and Jim please take it away yeah thank you Shanel so now we know that the dementor is some a creature that sucks or your soul how do you protect from such creatures so if we assume that our soul is bound in the confines of the physical matter of the brain then we can assume that the way to protect your soul is to sever that connection between the dementor and the Brain which in this case would be all your input the brain is getting your sight smell you know every interaction the brain have with the environment if you can isolate the brain from the environment then technically there's no way a dor can get you but um next page if if your soul is not only inside the brain but also somewhere else that the dementor can get a direct connection to then what it really comes down to is kind of a struggle between willpower is you know for different people some people might you know uh fight mentors by focusing on a good memory so that good memory is so strong that it doesn't get suck out by the dementor you know other people could focus on you know clearing their mind like meditation so that there's nothing that the dentor can take from their mind and um that's really comes down to different person and that's a few ways Harry can protect himself and on to you M okay thank you Jim because the theme of this live stream is Harry Potter but specifically episodic memory uh I would like to Carry On by exploring episodic memory from the point of view of Dreams because I think there are insights that we can learn from these exploring dreams and for instance to differentiate Consciousness and awareness in dreams dreaming shows us that cerebral Consciousness is not abolished despite that greatly diminished awareness of external impeachments and ability to respond to them hence an awareness is a more accurate work to describe the state of the sleeping brain than is and Consciousness with this what I mean is that and this is something that is very intriguing when we are dreaming we have these Vivid images and there are these bizarre things that are happening to us when we remember them remember them as happening to us so that means that we we kept a sense of selfhood even when what we're experiencing is not real so we could say that there is some Consciousness in dreams but there is an awareness because we are unable to tell that this is not real we are we don't know that this is not happening and that's why we can get so agitated while dreaming unless we talk of lucid dreams that is are very specific type of dreaming and at least in my case it never happened to me and it's when these people that can that know they are dreaming they experience things that are not real but normally you know it is you but you don't know what you are experiencing is not happening until you wake up okay now our brain keeps separate episodic memory of the often bizarre experiences of our n and real self from it episodic memory about our real life personal narrative our wake self we can also learn about selfhood linearity of time of dreams we en visit our lifetime narrative sequentially as if in a virtual world rather than this joint as disconnected happenings in a desperate spal context we experience dreams as episodes that involve us personally so we have preserve this sense of selfhood that we recall them later show that we have formed episodic memories of them why does our brain store false episodic events that's a very intriguing question I mean which is the point of restoring things that never actually happened and more importantly how is the brain able to give separate the threats of what our awake self experiences and stores from what our needing self experiences and Stor it is important and this is a remarkable fit on the part of our brains we do not conflate actual anic personal stor events so the things that happen to us when we are awake are not complet with the things that happen to us while dreaming so the awake self stor information in a timeline that is continuous and flowing in a forward Direction whereas the unic self Recollections are not stored in relation to any time frame therefore there is no life history for our in self that develops in parall with that of our awake self figuratively speaking the awake self is recording events in a tape which is running continously forward whereas the tape is stopped when the episodic memories are created and a store for the uni itself this is something that I find very remarkable because if you think about it these episodic memories we place them in an imaginary timeline and we place them in a specific order forward order the oldest go first the latest adquisition go last and by creating this imaginary timeline I think we preserve this sense of selfhood because we don't see ourself in different times like different persons we see us experiencing things at different moments in times even when we have changed a lot from when we were teenagers we always think it is ourselves and I think that is because we create a narrative of Our Lives probably this is also help by The Faculty of language we can't tell our stories but I think it it is essential that we place our life in a timeline subjective timeline now what I came to notice with my own experience is that my self of dream has no age and I don't have n cell teenager or a kid there is no narrative for this onic cell so I think that might be the key for the brain to keep these separate threats so those things that I put in a sequence in this subjective timeline are real things those things that are not placed there are not real this is a hypothesis of mine but I guess this ability to put things that happen to us in a timeline is essential to give this sense of selfhood yeah sorry go ahead Hector yeah this is um I just want to reiterate what an incredible idea this is that you the brain really does not conflate storing dream Hector from waking State Hector and it's really profound how that's actually happening so just to sort of try to mathematize what that oniric self feels like looks like so I had this idea that the oniric self was something um oniric self is profinite which everybody knows I love I'm talking about profinite sets and things like that so what we try to do is we we're going to consider this narrative time linear personhood time as constructed from the recall of stored episodic memories about waking State events so these are going to be connected in a topological space carrying the standard topology and admitting just a linear ordering so what we're trying to do is actually talk about the topology of storage we're going to give the the storage space an actual structure so we're going to say that the topology of our awake self episodic memory of waking States um is actually um interpretable in formal terms of this topological storage so in contrast the iric State events occur disconnected from one another in a profinite space profinite space is a compact totally disconnected hos dorf topological space taking the form of a a stone space so events damt by our oniric self are not stored relative to linear time so I thought possibly that a plausible model for dream time would actually be the Ring of ptic integer zp considered as a topological space so just to quickly recap the ptic number system the pic number system is this incredible non archimedian system that is the other completion of the rational numbers under What's called the ptic metric where P denotes a prime number and what's very curious is that peic numbers are close if their difference is a high power of P so we have a new notion of closeness here and the pic numbers have no notion of linear ordering and their shape resembles a self-similar set so when I say there's no notion of linear ordering no notion of bigger than smaller than these Concepts don't exist there and so imagine it seemed kind of AO like Hector was saying there you know Hector does not have a oniric child self um versus like an oniric adult self this sort of before after doesn't exist there um and so informally the Ring of ptic inures they're written in base p and they admit infinite expansions to the left of the decimal point that's the new piece so what I was thinking is that well let's try to model the set of events that happened to an onic self so we're going to call the set of events experienced by that oniric self to be modeled as a profinite set we're going to take what we call event from work earlier from Chris fields and I about constructing condensed memories and so we're going to call an event a complete instantaneous experienced event and so super cool from again a formal standpoint this profinite set it's a compact oor totally disconnected topological space totally disconnected meaning the only connected parts are the Singleton so this space is very strange um no notion of a Continuum there so why do we need the hos dworf Criterion why is that important well I thought this was really interesting the hostor Criterion ensures that there is no simultaneous experience occurring in the oniric dream state so that events can actually be a disjoint they don't sort of if the events overlapped that would be even more of a nightmare that you could have these simultaneous experiences even though that is a dream of mine um that is so every point in the profinite space uniquely represents an event that has occurred anally it's just there is no ordering to these things so there is a crucial difference I would really like to highlight between awake States and dream time and so to really understand that Criterion of total disconnectedness I would like to just say something so um a key aspect of the construction of waking time is the assumption that between any two distinct events experienced by some agent a other things happened that a did not experience but some other agent B may have experience so case in point if I'm um agent a and Daniel is Agent B and I'm taking a mathematics qualifying exam right and um Daniel is in Davis right doing amazing things so I am you know Daniel's experiencing events that I am not do we agree so I'm taking this mathematics exam during that time something else is happening that Daniel's actually experiencing you're not going to get that sort of Continuum in between when you have a totally disconnected set and so that's what we were trying to say like you cannot say in the oniric space that something happens that a did not does not experience it's very curious so that's not the case for an event in an oniric State just because the disconnected properties so um a nice example of a stone space and probably the famous canonical example is the caner Turner Set This brilliant amazing set is nowhere dense meaning these points are not tightly clustered has no interior points it's negligible has measure zero like size zero so H if the so if the onir self is composed of events that occur in this Stone space such as like a Turner caner Turner set then the onir self would be something like a caner dust and that's the main claim the waking State oh you know here's Shana talking to everybody here here's a little Artemis walking by okay and uh so thanks em so we have you know um The Waking State and then we have Shana's sleep state would be caner dust and I think that's an incredible image to have please have that when we're talking about this and and what's also fascinating is that the caner set um is also self-similar so it exhibits fractal behavior that and these could actually represent the time Loops that Hector is referring to like perhaps in the um oniric State you have layers of inception like Mr noan brilliantly showed layers of dream state or you're actually stuck in a loop um recurring and you can't really get out of that Loop so the caner Turner said here's a nice visualization of that you have the closed interval from 0 to one byit tary I mean you delete you remove the open middle third leaving this second line that has the two the cut intervals and you continue the process so from those two intervals I delete the open middle third I continue and this shows the first seven iterations of that so you continue this process at INF an item you can imagine at Infinity the amount of little points that would end at the end so on this screen I would like you to just sort of take a visualization and think that the personhood your waking state so shanana talking to you right now waking shanana qualifying exam shanana um can be represented by that top red line the solid red line there is a Continuum this comes before this and think of the oniric self as like you know basically starting at this level seven iteration just sprinkles um awesome so it's an infinite process just a little bit more about the construction what's really beautiful about the caner set is that the caner Turner set consists of all points that remain that are never deleted from the original interval so the caner that can consists of the points that remain after I continue this process at infinum the caner set is uncountably infinite so it's the scary Infinity having the same number of points as the closed interval 01 which is also kind of the infinite you think that's actually quite curious you would think that nothing would remain after I keep deleting things but actually uncountably infinitely many things remain okay super fun so again you can think of a personhood in this Top Line self as the adinin item sort of process just to wrap up the caner set the self similarity can be thought of as follows so if um if you remember in last stream I showed the beautiful viros function that if you zoomed on on one of the nodes you look at the local Behavior you zoom in on it and you can see the global Behavior inside the local Behavior well if you sort of focus on this pink highlighted region if I actually magnify this region and actually translate thanks baby if I actually magnify the region and I translate this piece I can actually see the global caner set in this local caner set and that's actually a very curious property it's a very difficult thing to actually have fractal Behavior inside a set so we're going to say that the Canter Turner set exhibits self-similar behavior and this is fractal Behavior so if you actually magnify certain pieces translate them around like this pink piece you actually can see the set again and that's really strange so the onir self can have this sort of self similarity and that's also a mathematical explanation for these time Loops um awesome cool and so just to do a quick recap so in brief the waking State events are going to occur in a connected space admitting a linear ordering well-defined notion of before after young self adult self this notion is not admitted in the profinite setting so events that occur in the waking state are stored with a linear ordering and the intuition that the waking state stores episodic me memories in linear time can also be understood topologically as a glue in terms of the consistency of typing across a collection of memories is effectively a gluing condition so I glue together these events um Cate categorical typings and put together and construct a personhood this is my this is me my waking state but nevertheless the cerebral neuronal microcircuitry has yet to be demonstrated which maintains alternative storage systems and causes the switching this is what Hector's asking how can you store these separately and how do you switch back and forth which is um really brilliant so another way to think about these time Loops is to illustrate them and then Jim if you can please explain what you've done here all right thank you sh so imagine you are on a rocket and you're traveling through space and that you know you look outside the window and you see all the stars going by and you tell yourself hey I'm traveling a rocket but what I tell you that you are actually still on the ground and your rocket is not moving so basically um next page so what if you cannot tell the difference between dream and reality without a thir perspective what if that dream is so real to you that you know you believe it that that dream is the reality and that there's nobody there to tell you what happened then you know that will become your reality and the vice versa would also happen you know what if you cannot make sense of reality as it happens what if you know uh even that you have exterior perspective telling you what's happening that you don't believe that is what's really happened and you're only believe what you think is the reality how do you defate between that so that would leave to the next section so cool Jim I love this image and how can you really tell so to talk about curious realities we really want to just take a second and talk about a very very important case um of a of a sort of double-edged Amnesia so there is um a a beautiful person called Clyde wearing and he was a a famous concert pianist somehow got ill got an illness and actually has this double-edged Amnesia that I'm going to ask Hector to talk about and Clive has about because of the the sickness Clive has about a six-second memory and there's beautiful BBC episodes and videos of him I encourage people to watch to look these up and CLA is famous for saying a many things but also one thing that CLA said that really struck me was that he said home is yesterday and he was asked sort of where he lives and I thought that's really powerful I've spoken of Clive before in one of the math Arts dreams and so for Clive to say home is yesterday and Clive has a six-second memory and with with this Amnesia may not even have a yesterday I thought that was very powerful because normally someone will say like Shana says my home is in Pasadena right it's sort of a spatial spatial sort of orientation and Clive's home is a temporality so Hector can you offer offer us some insights maybe talk about the amnes that Clive is facing and the brilliant thoughts you were having on like executive control in the Clive wearing State yeah I think this is a kind of peculiar case and I don't have all the details I don't have read anything scientific about this case but I watched some short clips on the internet and something that I think this case illustrates for The Limited information I have is that this person CLI wearing has lost the ability to form declarative memories but he can he has preserve this um non declarative memory or at least part of it for instance he does not even remember that he was playing or which music he was playing but you put him in a piano and he's a total virtuos so he's an amazing Pion so he has not forgotten this more motoric kind of memory so this is something interesting and in this case I think he has both anterograde amnesia for declarative type of memory and also retrograde because I believe he cannot retrieve any episodic memory of his he's unable to remember his life before he had this uh this problem this health problem so I think that makes a very uh very peculiar case if you will and more thing we can say of Cliff that I think in relation to this homies yesterday I think that there are go to next slide please I think that um it is clear that Cliff does not have episodic recollection he cannot remember his life he can recognize his wife though which is interesting but it seems that he does not remember anything from his past life and when he says homies yesterday I was just wondering what if for C yesterday does not mean a a play time in this timeline and he's referring to a special coordinate because I was thinking that when you are creating this Narrative of your life you're position in this episodic events of your life in this imaginary timeline for Cliff this is disrupted is like his timeline is no more he has no past so figuratively I think of it like could it happen that the time dimension of CLI has collapsed into a space and for him time labels make no sense anymore so they are meaningless and his brain has just recycled them so now when he uses labels that refer to temporal coordinates for him they are special coordinates I'm just wondering if this might be even possible it's not something I could demonstrate obviously but I think it's an intriguing case and to finish with this part I there is a book that I read a passage in the first live stream because I'm a big fan of Umberto Echo also har Potter of rolling but Umberto EO had this character that is a librarian that has this terrible Amnesia so he cannot remember anything from his past he cannot forming memories either and this is something that this character says in in a fragment of the book he says I was dosing and the clock woke me I didn't hear the first few times distinctly that is to say I didn't count them but as soon as I decided to count I realized that there had already been three so I was able to count four five and so on I understood that I could say four and then wait for the fifth because one two and three had passed and I somehow knew that if the fourth time had been the first I was conscious of I would have thought it was six o' I think our lives are like that you can only anticipate the future if you can called the past to mind I think this is a beautiful example how you put this thing this life in a timeline and what might happen if you don't have this timeline anymore that could be the CLI I think this could illustrate C's case I mean c is even I think has more problems than this character of the book but I think Umberto Co captures this essence of how the past can inform your future I love it Hector and just to ask one more question about five before we go and I know Jim used you you made a very full comment to characterize that Hector can you just give us a feel of what it's like to have both in anterograde and a retrograde amnesia wow you must be very scary because imagine what happens his I mean I remember this clip I don't know kind you know better the case but I remember he I think he could get like wor when someone enter the room where he was because he only recognizes a wife I'm in correct so imagine what can be your life if you do not recognize anyone and everything start a new every six seconds um and if we talk of active inference and then I I would like to pick up Daniel bra on this if you think in active inference I would say does Clive has generative models has priors because he has forgotten all this information of his past how is he making inferences how is he predicting what is going to happen how is his surprise I mean it could be off the chge if you don't I mean then I will formulate this this question more specifically for you Daniel if you dare to to take it because I think you know better than me all these things so but we have something we can say also before we go with that next slide please s there were some questions that I would like to formulate Daniel yeah these are the questions Daniel for you um one question I don't know we could first finish with the play case I mean it's related anyway I just wanted you to tell us how having episodic memory might help to reduce expected free energy minimize the expected free energy because I feel this is clearly related does anyone else want to go first I just want to recrop the video and think about it for a second too yeah Jim if you want to like while Daniel's getting ready can you um can you kind of say what you said yesterday that you thought it was like about the skill set because everyone there's a there's a clip where Clive sort of plays the piano and sort of goes into a very strange State sort of on the way out and Jim you said so cool yesterday do you remember what you said yeah um I think um because he was playing the instrument like he knows you know all the all his piano skill um still but um um I I think it was as soon as he step off the piano he was kind of like looking weird because he was he might thinking that like how did he just do that he have no recollection of you know any memories and he can't really replicate the skill in his mind it's almost like you just did amazing SC and you couldn't remember how you did it or you know like how you have that skill on you you just did it and there's no recollection in your memory whatsoever of replicating of why you know like why you did that and you know how is it possible you couldn't recall it I think that's why he so weird yeah that's really interesting well thank you all for the different sections there's so many places to jump in and that is kind of the question how does planning over the words that one says or the thoughts that one has or get it onto the record Groove like what is really the pherone trail that gets traced that's the continuous line and then what if the nestmate is dreaming so they're in that cancer dust um Hector emphasized that there was a a actionable relevance for episodic memory that in and even possibly selective benefit where the skill or the capacity for episodic recall could be like directly or related to ability to PL plan and so in light of that kind of active inference nod to planning as inference then I was seeing the cancer set as kind of like the garden of forking paths so it's like the timeline is zero affordances then with The Gap introduced there's like a left right choice so it's kind of this classical perhaps Quantum reduce at then okay if there's two affordances at each time step it's a coin flip so then there's Tails Tails heads heads Heads Tails so then all of those going on and on and on getting more dust likee and then um shanana highlighted that that has this kind of type of infinity that it is even though it was only reached by reduction and I wrote a few things down that will return to I think in the William Blake discussion because so many wonderful math art topics like vision and spatializing time and the timing space and things that like Shana explores in her books and also in the papers so I think there's a lot of ways to explore it I guess I'll just say lastly the others one of the many other possible actim connections is you initially describe the Dementors as spectral and so in statistics something spectral might be like the EEG Wave band with like a forer transform or the spectral analysis of a matrix so it's kind of like oh this this mental or cognitive state is associated with decreased power in the Theta where R sleep is associated with increase of this Spectra and then that was connected to mortality and I think that's the a moral so then we've been hearing recently an active inference about the mortal and immortal Computing and where's the relevance of the substrate and then math art with this int you know a for art and then what is it could there be a mortal are there only two buckets for computing or what what is that so I think that's these are all excellent paths and it was also nostalgic and interesting having remembered having had red hair har Potter but not being able to per se recall any quote anytime I sat down to read it even though it may have been multiple times but I don't even remember so then where does that all fit within this like what is reconstructed what is remembered when even many of so I look forward to continuing that exploration wow wow Daniel like amazing with um the sort of of spectral um dementor spectral a mortal a for art that's incredible that's incredible yeah we want to say um um Hector do you want to say anything else before I wrap up no I'm fine thank you I think we more or less said it was relevant there are so many things to say that we would never end so don't get me started I just want to say um one more thing and show I ended this slide just a little early um so we want to say definitely thank you everybody and also what's coming up on our next stream um before we do William Blake we're also going to have Daniel featuring steppen wolf and this is going to be really incredible so probably steppen wolf and Blake at the same time but I want to say thank you to everyone watching us and for joining us and we want to also um just put a little plug in for our next stream where we're actually going to try to tackle what we think is the one of the like second most powerful Concepts in in this series this new chapter for us which is animagus and um which is very strange the that that that notion itself is very strange to contrast animagus with like Ramis Lupin and the werewolf um to contrast Sirus Black is animagus and the very very very tricky notion of self-confirmation so we're going to be asking Daniel and Hector for a lot of help on Concepts like morphogenesis and autop poesis and so we just thought that looking at act looking at um active inflence through Harry Potter might just elucidate some of these Concepts that are a little tricky so I just want to say thank you to Daniel thank you Hector and thank you Jim and thank you Mattias for protecting us I had a great time okay till 7 thank you all thank you bye
