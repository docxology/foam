foreign [Music] [Music] we're in active inference live stream number 50.1 on October 20th 2022. we're discussing the paper interception as modeling allostasis as control welcome to the active inference Institute we're a participatory online Institute that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference this is a recorded in an archived live stream so please provide feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and will be following video etiquette for live streams head over to activeinference.org to learn more about how to get involved with different learning groups and projects like the live streams and otherwise we're here in live stream number 50.1 with our second discussion of the paper interception as modeling allostasis as control previously we had number 50.0 where Dean and I provided some background and context and now we're really appreciative that we'll have some authors joining for the dot one and two to unpack and explore some ideas and uh today it'll be great to hear from multiple authors see a little presentation and dive into the middle of things the thick of things as we do in the dot one and so we'll begin with introductions then we will have a presentation and then discussion so we'll begin with introductions with non-authors first and they can feel free to introduce say hi and anything that they're excited to explore today so I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I'm looking forward to understanding some of the formalisms in the model and how they connect to active inference and Bayesian mechanics and I'll pass to Dave hi I'm Dave I'm a um discourse curator a student of Jacques punks it and Mark soles I live in the mile high academic city of Baguio 200 kilometers north of Manila Dean thanks Dave I'm Dean I'm at Calgary um what's interesting to me is that on a metaphorical level this started out me in a in an open field and I got into a forest and that Forest got denser and dents and by the time we got to section four of this paper I started reading it over and over again which is a fantastic sign because if I have to read something many many times to really get my head around it that that's good because I don't question things unless I don't get them that doesn't mean that that it wasn't spelled out correctly it just means that you got my attention so um I'm not sure which author to pass it to First maybe Eli you'd like to say hi hello everyone um I'm Eli I'm the first author on this paper so um a bit before the live stream started Jordan was mentioning that this work comes out of what we were sort of studying together in our lab at an energetics working group brain energetics reading group before the pandemic really hit us and so when I was confined you know I effectively started reading and rereading you know everything that we had gone through and trying to come up with some way to think about allostasis because in our group and in our previous Publications as a group The interdisciplinary act affective science lab we've referenced allostasis a lot and every time I would ask you know how can we give a mathematical or computational characterization of allostasis I would basically be told well you know we thought Peter Sterling had one and then I would go look at Peter Sterling and he's the originator of the concept of allostasis by the way so there's numerous works by him on the subject probably the longest form let's say non-expert treatment would probably be his book what is health hey and when I would look at Sterling's work I would sort of spot a contradiction or a contradiction in terms one of on one side he's specifically charting the variation in physiological parameters and regulation over time where time can be the course of a lifetime in the course of development or even just the course of a single day and yet on the other hand if you ask him well how is this done he would effectively um say this is done by reinforcement learning via the dopaminergic systems in the brain now the dopaminergic systems in the brain don't track a shifting signal over time they just maximize reward and so actually in my view at least as a computationalist they were more homeostatic than allostatic and from that contradiction and what followed on from it really came this whole paper foreign but to re-emphasize I would say and before we jump into you know slides material inside the paper I think it's really worth emphasizing just based on watching the 50.0 live stream that our group are more let's say biologists and physiologists in orientation than physicists so Bayesian the paper on Bayesian mechanics came out while we were writing this and I don't think we really managed to integrate the two sets of material yet together or together yet that's not to say they can't or shouldn't be integrated it's to say we don't actually have so to speak we don't always have the physics and dynamical systems expertise of someone like Thomas Parr or Maxwell ramstead let alone Karl Kristen on the other hand we have very concrete Notions of what biology and Physiology we need to fit to as really the bulk of this paper you know the reason it's not just a short section for with some math is because we have to fit to the physiology and Anatomy that we know about thank you Jordan feel free to intro and then Eli off to you for some presentation for sure so so I'm a postdoc in the lab here so I think maybe I'll just give some context of where we're both working too and how we've got here so for me I've had a bit of a weird path to get to this point in that I did my PHD in social psychology and moral psychology um it's then uh sort of trans got really really interested in predictive processing perspectives and active inference and then really wanted to dig into that and find someone who's working on it around here in Boston uh so I'm working with Lisa Feldman Barrett and Karen quickly who co-direct the interdisciplinary affective Sciences lab here um and like you guys saying the perspective that we have is really more of a biologically grounded one or more of one that's based in um in physiology and Neuroscience So Lisa and Carol joke that Lisa sort of handles everything from the neck up and Karen handles everything from the neck down so together they form a whole person um and what what I was really lucky to do was I stumbled into um an existing collaboration that did going on for about a decade here um which we call the psychology engineering Neuroscience group or the pen group where there's been an ongoing collaboration with uh professors in the electrical engineering department probably most importantly Dana Brooks has really helped to run it a lot that Dennis abdogmas and Jennifer D have both also been like really really involved in this um and so what they would do is they'd meet every week and they would sort of pull through on active interest papers processing papers uh information Theory they'd sort of catch all of us neuroscientists up to speed on understanding engineering and we try to bring them up to speed on on a sort of biological understanding of Neuroscience too so what um what we've been really interested in doing is thinking about some of the abstractions that had come up in the act of inference literature and thinking about how to ground those biological processes um and how to really make this tractable at an empirical biological level and so the interest that I've had in brain energetics has been um a way to apply some of that traction onto um my original interest which is sort of moral and social norms so I've done a bit of work on um thinking about how we can think about information or energetic costs of information processing as a way of um how individuals exercise control over a social environment by conforming to expectations within it and then at the same time I've been interested in going into the other end and thinking about um some of the details of brain metabolism and brain glucose metabolism that are associated with the Bold fmri signal so that we can really Dig Down Deeper into the metabolism that's underlying the neural Imaging their image in literature um but in the process of basically performing this or forming this energetics reading group where we've been digging into all of those topics to try to understand the brain biology Eli and I really ended up working together in this paper to try to apply some of that energetics um and biological work um again with a ton of help from Karen and Lisa who really know the details of of the neuroscience and the actual physiology I think Karen especially that Eli would probably say has been like really really really critical for for understanding these physiological systems um but basically yeah how we can have some of the parameters and assumptions of these active inference models grounded in real biological terms that we can start to look to the empirical literature the biological biological literature and sort of gain some more inspiration from that rather than just living living entirely at an abstract level cool and with that I'll hand it over to Eli excellent all right I've unshared feel free to go for it thanks for that context and just of note um it did um this paper does bring in some topics that we haven't discussed on any of the preceding 50 papers uh many of which were also motivators of what you set out to explore so I'll just crop in resize and so on and Eli please go for it all right um so before I really get into the material of the paper I think it might be useful to follow on from what Jordan said in order to additionally motivate sort of our turn towards biology and Physiology here which is that most of the time inactive inference modeling note that I say modeling or an active interns physics so to speak you need a term in your expected free energy or in your joint density that is sorry the generative joint density not the recognition one which you would call often I've heard it called the prior preferences essentially a probability density over sensory outcomes that describes what it's hard to avoid anthropomorphic language here but oh well what you want to observe now in real biological systems that you know as we sort of can hear from Peter Sterling or numerous other authors that cannot be fixed the that is you know prior preferences can't be fixed it's I do I prefer different observations when I'm about to go to sleep versus when I am waking up and the assumption that usually gets baked into principles like say the free energy principle is that actually let me moderate that a little bit based on conversations with some free energy principle folks if you have a non-path based a state-based formulation of the free energy principle then you will typically assume something called ergoticity and you'll note that we have an appendix about ergoticity I saw that you discussed it last week in the point zero episode thank you for catching on to that and thank you to anyone in the audience and the listenership who caught on to that the ergodicity Assumption essentially allows you to exchange uncertainty about time or over time for uncertainty in the moment so you can just say there's a gaussian prior preference density it has this much Precision or this much variance depending on which uh which way you prefer to put your division sign and then it's the same for all time now if you're doing a paths-based formulation then you lose the tie between the free energy principle and conventional physiological Notions of homeostasis because now after all can't the set point be anything or everything you need to know something about physiology Anatomy to tie it back and so that's really the motivation we're coming from in this paper is what if you have to acquire or learn prior preferences throughout development how little can you bake in and so we start by sort of reviewing in the paper and in these slides the sort of perspectives that we study from study the nervous system study the brain one of them is predictive processing I think that's probably going to be the important one for this audience and in predictive processing we talk about the perceptual systems of the brain really the sensory systems as performing approximate Bayesian inference so then you'll have top-down prediction signals bottom-up prediction error signals and there's this notion of active inference which says that we essentially treat motor outputs as parameters to the recognition model in one of its in one of the earliest formulations before there was any expected free energy But ultimately it still says in any new or recent formulation we have some notion of prediction error between densities and this is an information theoretic quantity so really we're talking about a Divergence or an entropy or a cross entropy we want to minimize that and we're not only going to minimize that by changing the top-down predictions that flow through say the sensory cortex we're also going to change these extra parameters that correspond to motor motor predictions motor commands motor references depending on the terminology you want to use to refer to them so then in our lab where we are sort of biologists of emotion we often study interception and that's really it's given a fairly vague definition on the slide here because there's a lot of debate among neuroanatomists about sort of where interception ends and x-star reception begins which exact modalities should be classified Which Way or Another but really interception is still a set of or category of sensory modalities and when I say sensory modalities I am mentioning that specifically because the literature on interceptive active inference then tends to take what we might call the earliest form of active inference it takes the road of the earliest form of active inference saying I have a generative density I have a recognition density action becomes effectively a parameter to fit the recognition density to the generative density and there isn't really a notion of an internal generative model that is separate that separates belief and desire so in a lot of the literature on interceptive active inference you'll find references to having very precise priors or even you know innate priors about interceptive parameters and you'll see this notion that you use active inference in the interceptive domain more than you use it in the somatic domain because you're trying to fit your internal physiology to a notion of apriori set points that are determined by evolution do you think you could give an example of that Eli and what sort of set points people might think all right let's see I've seen carbon dioxide levels in the blood mentioned glucose levels um core body temperature is really the one that I tend to go back to because it really does remain constant most of the time it can vary but really that's an inextremis type of situation so if you think about core body temperature there's a circuit and I believe you know Jordan correct me if I'm wrong but this is the NTS again isn't it the nucleus factors yeah okay yeah um essentially in the brain stem there's a circuit that codes the typical set point for core body temperature and from an active inference perspective you could say that is a fixed likelihood it can't be parameter re-parameterized by some prediction flowing from higher up or rather most of the time it is not re-parameterized so that flows down as a prediction and then every temperature sensor in the body can compare actual temperature to desired temperature calculate a Precision weighted prediction error between them send those errors back up and then the brain can say aha I need to find a way to minimize these errors and doing so will effectively keep you in an environment where you can maintain your core body temperature around you know I think it's 98.6 Fahrenheit is the stereotype it varies for individuals now the reason my next slide was about allostasis is because while there are bubbly parameters like core temperature that usually behave according to a set point really physiologically most parameters do not have a set point they move the regulated levels move all the time so that includes heart rate blood pressure blood sugar blood oxygen levels various hormone levels in the endocrine systems inflammation levels shift over time and I mentioned inflammation because you know from the body's perspective there is you know inflammation is not something with a set point of zero inflammation is sometimes appropriate and actually if you want to think you know what is the situation in which adapting all of these core parameters is physiologically adaptive then I think heavy exercise and sickness are probably the two largest examples so for heavy exercise we could talk about say arousal levels and that refers to the balance of Cooperative activity in the branches of the autonomic nervous system but essentially if you're going to go for a run say from a predator or after some food in your girl fashioned you know Evo psych ancestral environment you're going to need to decrease the activity in some organ systems increase the activity in other organ systems and adjust physiological parameters to be regulated to the new levels so this is a pretty well observed fact of physiology you know informally Peter Sterling I would say having invented allostasis as an observation that gets made he then editorializes a little bit about it and says it should replace homeostasis as a mode of Regulation so rather than having set points you should be comparing to something like a set trajectory and in the ideal case when you're theorizing you should assume that there is no Global set point of any parameter and of course as we mentioned before in extremists this is true if you get ill your body does actually override that circuit in the brain stem to raise the core temperature that's why you'll get chills you're at the same temperature but the regulated level has been shifted up there's there's also an interesting point to make if you go back for one sec you like to just that um in the way that the sort of language of science evolves here too and it's worth pointing out because some people might be listening and might be thinking you know well homeostasis doesn't have to include set points either you can have sort of higher gold ocean uponio stasis you can have um you know sort of multiple levels of control involved in that and some people have made the same criticism of allostasis as an ocean so there's a paper by Carpenter by Carpenter that that does exactly this right so it's but the problem is is that even if that's like that's technically true and people who really know what they're doing and are using a concept of homeostasis in that way might already understand that you don't necessarily need set points but the the reality is is that the way homeostasis tends to get used in the way that it tends to be understood is it's come to have some of this association with set points or with a simple thermostat model as opposed to something broader that includes multiple levels of control and so some people who might be some people might be curmudgeoni and want to say that homeostasis already includes all of these Notions so we should just reclaim the term homeostasis for that I think we're more of the perspective that we're willing to just give that up and it might be time to just start using a different term to remind people of those other associations so we're we're seeding ground a little bit when we're using the term allostasis to just not have to fight with people about what homeostasis really means yes so Jordan is completely correct there but I would actually even recommend that you know everyone listening if you can go find the paper homeostasis a plea for a unified approach by rhs Carpenter it's in our citations and you should be able to type the name into Google Scholar go look at it because it'll really explain where our paper is coming from as a short summary of what's relevant what Carpenter says in his paper is that back in the good old days they taught control theory and controls engineering to physiologists and that included you know research physiologists and also clinicians and by back in the day he really means back in like the 1940s to the 1960s before another new approach took over and she says hey if you're an educated mathematically mature and fluent controls engineer then you don't need you know then these awkward names are all really just different ways of cutting the same cake you know it's all a control system it's a hierarchical control system this is very evident he says in the anatomy and physiology that you'll look at he's even writing for a physiology education Journal and then he effectively starts complaining that you know everyone's sort of straw manned homeostasis down to this thermostat model and he has to complain like this in 2004 because indeed everyone really has sort of associated the word homeostasis with this thermostat model Global set points things like body temperature rather than blood glucose and as a result there's as a result much of the actual control theory got simplified away so even as someone who is housed in a computer science department took a class on reinforcement learning and can work the equations of optimal control theory I was not introduced to the concept of a reference signal as a Time varying function until Carpenter and that was actually pretty revelatory for me that rather than having an error function who's you know minimum whose Global minimum is fixed for all time you can have an error function that measures the difference between your actual trajectory and a desired trajectory you can do trajectory tracking control when you have the mathematics so we could say for our paper for our purposes if homeostasis refers to this thermiostat thermostat Style Point tracking control then allostasis refers to trajectory tracking control so moving on a little bit and getting back on the main track from our perspectives informed by physiology and Anatomy and a little bit of evodivo interception and allostasis have Pro have both pretty well demonstrated themselves to be really Central to how the nervous system is actually structured and seemingly largely concerned with the metabolism and deficient functioning of the viscera so for anyone who wants you know citations for this I think it's uh Jordan it would be Barrett and who 2015. oh uh Barrett and Simmons 2015. yes Neuroscience paper yeah nature reviews Neuroscience interceptive predictions in the brain there's a more recent review written by Karen Quigley our other senior author on interception came out in 2021 and so you can really go check for yourself and I would advise it just how Central in terreception and visceral regulation are empirically to the nervous system you could possibly design a nervous system for a robot that worked differently but the ones that evolved are ubiquitously centered on keeping the internal milia of the body efficient so um yes um Dan tickles yeah do you mind if I decided a quick question here of course yeah because uh the the two authors here maybe can just confirm that my parachute is packed properly that's what I'm basically wanting to to be comfortable with so just stepping back for a second in that slide that you would just head up there the warp and the weft here the kind of the weave that you guys were working on on this paper was the allostasis and the enteroception those were your focal points right and then you've you've spent quite a bit in sort of prepping us for the difference between the discrete time aspect of what you're looking at and the global capture rate because you say we can't we can't get fixed and just the one saying I want to make sure my my shoot is packed properly and then you're talking about biology and physiology so just on that on that great big am I going to go Splat or am I going to be able to land this relatively softly can you can you maybe just tell me whether or not that is in fact is it a comparison is it an intersection are these things running in parallel how much of this is risk management versus how much of this is strategic I would think of it more as an intersection okay and when we're specifically referring to quantities like the global capture rate those are intended to be strategic rather than risk management or epistemic value okay so specifically there there's a whole book on this let's say it um Vigor the neuro economics of movement control by Reza shadmir and it Chronicles in very long form extensively the empirical evidence that real organisms will time average their reward rate so in order to move from an episodic setting to a continual control set you know to a continual lifelong setting you need some notion of indefinite time control obviously you're not going to live until T you know T reaches Infinity but in the limit you do need to have a coherent control problem at least for modeling purposes because you can't fix the end of say a bird's life in the lab on a laptop okay and there's two ways conventionally to do that one is this notion of God and put the global capture rate so the time average the sum of all benefits minus the sum of all costs divided by the total amount of time and the other is exponential discounting now for engineering purposes exponential discounting makes the math and the computations much more tractable and so in the early 2000s they essentially found that the real you know real brains like basal ganglia you know and dopaminergic firing are best fitted by time averaging and then on the computational side everyone ignored that and did exponential discounting and so really when we talk about something like a global capture rate we're just saying we're going with the biological evidence and writing down a model that accounts best for the empirical bindings you know if you want to quote unquote try this at home you are perfectly welcome to go ahead and switch to exponential discounting it's fine or the machine Learning Community is starting to come out with papers on time averaging you know lately the past couple of years and that's one more quick question then of course yeah thank you for that for that explanation so if we're if we're raising the the question around tractability that assumes that there's some sort of slipperiness or some fluidity piece to this this thing that we're looking at what what is that what is that thing that's fluid that's slippery that's causing us to not normally be able to model is that a feature or is that a flaw I would say the slipperiness is the slippery that is the slip between map and territory okay so when talking about real brains we know that we observe time averaging in the territory what we don't know how to do is write an algorithm that provably produces correct time averaging and works in practice in engineering okay so let's even say rather than map and territory because the scientist has a map as well let's say the slippage is between empirical science and engineering and when we write out our model we are really trying to address the empirical science and we don't mind if engineers you know want to make their little slippage and use something that just makes the algorithmics easier that's fine you know and in fact that is what the Deep active inference Community does okay so heading back a little more towards active inference when we read all of this stuff this is sort of a bit of a Bible for our lab Sterling and Laughlin so Simon Laughlin was involved in some of the earliest Publications on predictive coding in the fly retina Peter Sterling is the originator of the concept of allostasis and what we actually notice as mentioned a bit earlier is this sort of slippage another slippage or contradiction so they say when you get a reward some dopamine is released this invokes a reinforcement learning principal algorithm you know let's be careful with neural circuits that we're not studying in detail for the moment that is Let's Be Careful how strong a statement we make about their function and then most of the empirical evidence they review in the book is about the Energy Efficiency of sensory firing so we're really trying to say we want to move from something grounded in minimizing a prediction error variational inference to something grounded ideally with an optimality principle in control so then there are some arguments for neuroscientists which are more or less intended to convince the Ewing neuroscientist that people studying interception and people studying motor neuroscience need to work together on studying the viscera you can't study the viscera and ignore the motor branch of the visceral nervous system and the functions of that motor branch now regarding you know our statement of you can't just minimize prediction error one might ask what about active inference and there we have to start being careful with the term active inference because you know as I have had it personally explained to me at length there are at least the two different kinds of active inference there's this very old um I think it was Adams 2013. you know motor active inference predictions not commands active inference in the motor you know in the motor system and then there's this notion of decision active inference where you have an expected free energy explicit prior preferences and so on and so on and if you talk to the active inference community you know read the papers that they can write for their own community I would particularly recommend you know the international workshop on active inference which I believe is going to be a conference next year they have three years of very good papers where many authors sketch out the explicit connections between active inference control as inference optimal control Etc so really when we bang on saying you know don't use active inference to reduce motor function to sensory function we're talking to some psychologists and philosophers who have been let's say quite enthusiastic about predictive processing but a bit eliminativist about some of the mathematical constructs that are actually used in active inference so then for our psychologist audience we have once again the argument that we are basically showing that you can and should do a fully probabilistic notion of optimal control in order to sort out what is going on with allostatic regulation and we're going to take some inspiration from motor neuroanatomy in doing it so looking at a simple model system and this is getting into figures from the paper we have our Barrel reflex afferent response curve you have a carroted baroreceptor it's in the Carotid artery in the neck it measures blood pressure projects to a circuit in the uh NTS in the brain stem and we bring this up here because the barrel receptor is often used as a model in terraceptor when I talked to Karen and asked for model systems of interception she actually said you know well let's think about the power receptor first and again with contradiction what we actually find looking at the anatomy is that the baroreceptor the Carotid Barrel receptor is the sensory branch of a low-level control circuit so the NTS will then have not I believe the middle inflection point is coded in the NTS here and doesn't really change much but what does happen is that you can get top down commands flowing into the MTS and then changing the gain of this circuit so the slope of the Curve and if you widen that slope so that the curve is shallower than your preserving responsiveness you're staying you're widening the approximately linear portion of the Curve while allowing for the blood pressure to rise and fall and so again we see for the interception people that you really need to think about you know what is the role of this Interceptor in control of the body and of the viscera you can't just look at it and say it's a sensor well okay it's a sensor where does IT project to um enteroceptive cortex no no not necessarily like you know the error the prediction error signals that reach interceptive cortex to say you know I can't pump enough blood or something like that might actually have already been processed by what I believe in the motor active inference literature is called a reflex arc so there might already be a reflect a reflex controller that has operated on that signal by the time it reaches the higher portions of the brain so in our paper we set out some vocabulary for people to use if they want to don't have to capacity curve in particular we're going to tie it to the notion of the cumulative distribution function later on there's some physiology terminology for people who want to learn it and then we note the same thing that Carpenter does Carpenter and a number of other papers which is that this is a massively hierarchical control system lots of regulated substances let's say or regulated variables are going to have multiple controllers influencing them so for instance blood nutrient levels not just glucose but I believe like salt fat water are regulated by pairs of hormones sometimes there will be multiple pairs of hormones per nutrient that has to be in the blood and this isn't a convex trade-off so that's not antagonistic competitive regulation they can appear to compete sometimes but actually it's Cooperative regulation based on the fact that so to speak chemical species can't encode negative numbers the way a digital signal can so when you do things with chemical signals having these pairs turns out to be the way to Monitor and control the dynamic range with the greatest sensitivity like so then using this example of glucagon and insulin we can see that sort of normal glycemia is really more of a range and it's a range where you're going to have approximately linear response of insulin activity and you're going to have saturated out or really you're going to have thresholded out glucagon activity so at a normal level of blood sugar glucagon does not have to retrieve additional blood sugar from the intestines or the liver it doesn't have to call for burning fat Reserves you essentially you've eaten enough for the day you're fine insulin is responsive in a highly responsive mode where it can give a linear response to a linear change in order to compensate for noise so now we can actually get towards you know now that we have a controls way to think about physiology we can get more towards these Notions of active inference and here we're going to go back to some of the sources on that gave us motor active inference one way to think about motor active inference is the brain sense of prediction the reflex arc in the spinal cord attempts to minimize prediction error by comparing the prediction with the value read off of a proprioceptor so again one way to think about that is having a few extra ways to minimize prediction error really entropy another way to think about that is to think of having a very Elementary control system at the reflex arc level and then the brain prescribes the reference length that is the reference signal for that controller and it just tries to minimize the difference between what it gets off a proprioceptor what it reads the actual muscle length and tension and the reference signal and this is actually a very I I'd almost call it a fun circuit to study because of just how well documented it is that there's something very much like I would almost say like a Precision weighted PID controller in there you know if you're a math person then a muscle is kind of like a spring spring can be you know the Dynamics for a spring metal spring stretch it and crunch it you know it can be linearized around certain points and you so you can just about write down an LTI PID controller for a must for an individual muscle spindle and you'll get two parameters coming down from the brain one of which says the reference length and the other of which says you know what's the sensitivity or gain against perturbation that you should exercise and this is actually how your voluntary movements are engaged so really all of this stuff about references that we're talking about here is just putting forward to the hypothesis that maybe visceral motor control works on the same computational and anatomical principles as voluntary somatomotor control of course instead of the commands coming down from say somatomotor cortex they might be coming from ganglia in the autonomic nervous system with the higher level central nervous system basically just prescribing rough levels of activity activation or deactivation for the two different sides of the autonomic nervous system which then again in this opponent fashion semi-opponent fully Cooperative fashion allow us to avoid encoding digital negative numbers and thereby give you very finely balanced control over the internal milia so we eventually get to our figure which essentially says if I know what resource supplies metabolic resource supplies nutrients oxygen carbon dioxide that sort of thing I'm going to have in the future then my goal is going to be let's not say to maximize uncertainty nor to minimize uncertainty but really to maximize resilience or freedom stay in the linear portion of a cumulative distribution function where you can be responsive to any remaining to any remaining or upcoming perturbation and so we draw here that you can have this capacity estimator close the loop and start directing motor actions via active inference in order to follow this preference for resilience against perturbation of the internal milia which is then tied to interceptive State estimation your other state estimators your actual sensory service services and this whole wiring diagram and maybe one thing just to add too right just to underscore a point is that would I think if you go back one slide here and so how this relates to the the sort of adaptive range of the settling Point too and what I think is really interesting about this right is that you're not defining like when we started out talking about how you might traditionally think about set points for homeostasis in like a very traditional thermostat model right what you're talking about here is that there's actually [Music] um if the overall goal of the brain if the brain is essentially there to help regulate and adapt to sort of entire biological system of the body to circumstances outside of it that are constantly going to be changing different challenges that it's going to have to be responsive to then you don't necessarily have a set point but you have a range um where you can where where the physiology can be most adaptable to those perturbations and challenges right and so even just I think to simplify a sort of I think that that idea is really at the core of what we're trying to talk about radio like that you essentially want to have um arrange where the physiology can be adaptive and yeah you would imagine that if the physiology is if if some of these parameters are pushed way way way far outside of the center of that sigmoid then you're going to have a problem in that they will not be able to adapt um to changes you're you're not going to be able to be at that linear point of Maximum adaptability if you're down here near the threshold and you get you know some random white noise that pushes you over that threshold obviously there isn't a discrete catastrophic failure but also obviously you can no longer mount a proportional response yeah your body is made of you know physical instruments which have a limited range of responsiveness yeah and so our notion of allostasis is to say when you can widen the range of responsiveness rather than narrowing it or rather widen the range of responsiveness when possible while narrowing the set of states or the distribution of states that you actually fall into yeah yeah and so you look like doing somewhat opposite things and and so would it be the case too right that you could have um there's different ways that you can have these systems become sort of maladaptive if that if that's if that linear if that sigmoid becomes steeper and steeper and steeper where you basically have it's just a very very narrow range where you can actually have an Adaptive response that can be one potential problem another potential problem can be when the sort of Baseline level like you're saying is pushed far outside of that threshold then also you're going to require a lot more work and a lot more controls or a lot more control of that system needed to really push it far outside of that range to actually adapt to push it back really to push it back again yeah which could could cause other problems Downstream as well right but but the point is just that you um the the sort of range that you want this system to settle into is a range where it can be adaptive to changes and prepare for for fluctuating sorts of circumstances right yeah so I think a good intuition to leave with since we are get drawing towards the end of the hour is that if you were to try to minimize interceptive uncertainty then what you might do is just stay home all the time your heart rate will never vary too much up and down and we're living in the modern world where you don't have to run away from Tigers so you know why deal with the uncertainty of going out and exercising or the perturbation of going out and exercising and what our notion of allostasis here might tell you in reply is to say when you go out and exercise the curve gets wider and so the Adaptive range where you can mount a proportional response gets wider so go out and exercise because it actually increases your resilience to physiology to Future physiological challenge so it's still within the active inference set of intuitions but we're really baking in this assumption that you should preemptively prepare yourself against possible challenge rather than effective rather than acting to avoid possible challenge we've moved the handling of challenge into the body uh Dean go ahead as you get to those extremes of those crisis moments we talk about a little bit about this in the dot zero how does the interplay or the instructional proportion change between something that's interactive and and range seeking to range re-entering I'm I'm curious if that if the formalisms change as as those extremes are are reached because as you said things things don't always become catastrophic you're irreversibly catastrophically um stat so what could you like based on what you guys have obviously looked at what what's your sense about how that how that relationship between interaction and instruction shifts as we get to those really hard limits uh Jordan you're often a little better on physiology than me do you want to take this or oh no I'm not sure I think you might have it um so let's see I'm honestly not so great of physiology because I rely on Karen for it I would almost say that there's a map territory failure here where we were trying to model so to speak normal function under normal function with that intuition about resilience against challenge okay and there's several possible responses to an extreme circumstance you know one is that some high up control mechanism can start overriding these these operating points pushing them away from where they normally are and then that allows you to deal with extreme circumstances by no longer treating them as errors at all so say if you're sick your core body temperature is modulated upwards that puts you in a fever state this is expensive metabolically and it feels bad compared to how you normally function but it should cook the germs and then when the extreme State you know when that emergency is over supposedly hopefully usually you'll be able to go back to normal function there are of course exceptions such as say long covet right just just to make sure though do you see a change in the amount of of literally commands and the amount of back and forth as as you approach those limits do you think they kind of just realize that they're they're getting closer and closer to uh a fall off point I think that's actually an open and empirical question okay so one of the reasons that we like went as far as writing a full mathematical model in this paper is because they're often there isn't that much empirical neurocomputational work on interception at all so if you ask very basic questions like is interception predictably coded below the neck that's still an open question it could be that peripheral and pterosceptors are just transducing a stimulus signal and then it's only predictably encoded when it hits the brain we don't know yet so we'd rather have some briefly lost Eli we've lost him but okay while Eli's rejoining okay very interesting a different path through the same material Dave if your question is for Eli we can wait a few seconds not necessarily um I have just a a a a side comment you don't necessarily have to respond to this the discussion reminds me of two different fallacies one is the dark room fallacy you know if you want to minimize it's a kind of a parody of active inference if you don't want to be if you don't want to be surprised then just stay in a dark room where nothing changes which has been dismissed pretty thoroughly by active insurance activists right also there was a a fallacy kind of a social darwiness tinged interpretation of the the observation that every species has a fixed number of heartbeats and therefore valuable people members of parliament and clergyman stood not work because you're eating up your lifetime right which of course doesn't isn't true because your heart beats more slowly so it's stretched out more if you're in good shape right um but more more relevant um the steepness of the reflex curve I I sometimes feel that folks working in active inference cover may be too much with the notion of precision that's this is one quantity and it looks like the that slope in the uh blood pressure curve but that might is that something that would tend to be covered by the term precision and if so should that be a proportion a more differentiated way rather than just being a single number that applies in lots and lots of areas of control and perception that's interesting so so normally the Precision right is normally applied to the predictions so there's a there's an idea of the Precision of the predictions being applied and in this case I think the idea is more of um so it it comes back to where the uh you might be talking about prior preferences being targeted in active inference models um and I think the slope the the response curve there is instead trying to Target that use of Prior preferences right so it's trying to Target specifically where is um where is the system trying to be navigated it's it's been yeah when people talk about prior preferences they've talked about it sometimes in terms of uh the system having a sort of strong prior strong precise priors being encoded um like a priori prior is being encoded uh to be targeted and in this case I think it's um we're trying to give an account of where some of those priors can come from and how these systems and how sort of opponent processes can or opponent uh chemicals can help regulate the physiology um and we're trying to get a more natural approach of where those can come about from so but I think um if it is replaced I'm just trying to think to talk aloud to Think Through the question so if it is replacing basically a prior preference and um if normally that prior preference would be handled by uh a sort of precision account of it then to some extent the um the steepness of that curve is trying to tackle uh it's somewhat of a replacement of the Precision but um but yeah it's uh it's it's giving a different way of um yeah maybe it is a replacement for the position in that case Eli's back so maybe you I can try to answer your question Eli do you want to complete your presentation um sure but if just to answer the question if we're talking about the gain on one of these signoid curves then yeah that's sort of a replacement for the Precision but it's really thinking about it's thinking about it the all the other way around so a variance quantifies your tolerance for error a Precision or a gain quantifies response to error yes yeah so when you're talking about purely sensory these extra receptive signals the ones that aren't prescribing references to you in any way then of course you know you want to save the neural response which is metabolically expensive for precise signals if you're talking about an internal you know physiological curve say reaction to a change in blood pressure then you want to try and make the gain shallower you want to tolerate variance sorry about um getting my my home modem I think just restarted itself for no apparent reason we call that a sleep wake cycle yeah um how about it did some sleep phase gradient updates but it's simpler it's refreshed um it's ready for you to complete the presentation and then we'll return very um interesting though so okay um see share screen here we are all right continue yeah so now we start getting into really what scant um visual material is available for section four which I think we'll have to go over in detail in a more q a format a little bit but so if we then want to talk about how do we integrate decision active inference into this allostatic View then we can say decision making is this notion of optimal control control subject to a set of expectations about the future so we'll have to write an objective function and then we'll have our wiring diagram back and we'll note that motor references issued top down are now conditioned upon or subject to predictions about the future then part of how we're going to get into what this objective function is actually made up out of is to First Take the intuition that if we start from neural circuits that can only do predictive processing as we know it then one thing we can do with them is you know simulate some Ensemble or population of potential state trajectories or really State action trajectories starting from some initial state then you know given an objective function we can estimate the time average given our ensemble we can turn that into feedback control getting the stability in control theory the closed loop stability derived from using feedback by then having a recognition model and then we can say ah I'm going to update my entire ensemble or population of simulations by taking them from the recognition model which is conditional upon observed sensory outcomes and then having predictions from the recognition density which we're superscripting here with superscript you know parentheses too in comparison to superscript parentheses one here we can then penalize a notion of distance so really we can penalize the quote-unquote size of the update in information theoretic terms and if you've seen a free energy or an expected free energy written out term by term before you should have seen one of these it's a KL Divergence but what that gives us is feedback stabilized control using probability models and that actually gets to more or less the end of the slides per se so as a few summary points are computational model gives us a useful notion of affordance competition basically run up run a bunch of forward simulations pick the ones that are going to have good expected values over time averaging to actually enact as motor references the sigmoidal curves after we've taken their derivatives to convert them to probability densities you know then taking the logarithm of those to convert to log densities which is much more typical for you know active inference like a log prior preference those actually provide a notion of common currency foreign because now we've normalized you know all notion of probability Mass to one so a density over one variable and a density over the other variable have the same units we don't need any more notion of a reward currency in this model then there's some encouragement for the anatomists and physiologists to say hey let's go look at autonomic and visceral motor regulation and see if we can understand it in terms of these motor control circuits at the low level and that just brings us to you know some very overall conclusions ideally our work should be placed in dialogue with you know active inference as control work by other authors and of course acknowledgments you can really see here how much work went into this on behalf of absolutely everyone in the team and references so I'll stop sharing and we can shift to a more interactive format awesome well thanks for sharing that and so where was that previously shared in what context um just in the context of our lab group all right cool so we're going to slide the College of Engineering Group we were talking yeah yeah so the slides are really made for this like biologists psychology with a few engineers group cool okay well many many ways many paths to go just to kind of highlight a few pieces under this broad umbrella of physiology one important point you raised um was how much homeostasis same stasis is in effect versus a mechanism of actually is that stabilization sometimes empirically of stasis and even homeostasis is that under Lane by a drive to a set point as it has been simplified or understood as in that simple thermometer model and then to what extent do we bring in allostasis hormesis arousal and different physiological phenomena and consider these all part of just the dynamic and multimodal homeostatic engagements of complex bodies versus um discard the old and with the new and how much to lump and split physiology when even at the single cellular life form level they're engaging from a computational or control or information theoretic perspective in processes that are analogous to some of these that's one point that we can explore another area to explore is on that theme of what are these systems doing and how do we model it the map territory or the um engineering basic research question we could talk about a given physiological process body temperature stabilization or the baroreceptor the glucose and so on is there the minimization of a difference for example between preferred and observed is there a maximization of reward According to some reward function is there a maximization of precision Precision on what is there a maximization of responsivity which corresponds in the sigmoidal curve family to the linearized region are there cases where all four of these things are going to be happening indistinguishably is there a case where some of these phenomena are occurring at the detriment of others can we differentiate models and actually make unique predictions explanations and control systems if we move our emphasis from one of these lenses to another lens and how should we think about different physiological systems ranging from the implicit and very ancient mechanisms to those which consciously may even feel like for example error minimization reward maximization precision maximization responsivity maximization so I'll pause there and either authors may make some remarks or anyone May raise a question or thought Eli I just wanted to ask you maybe just to direct within this because you talked at the end about a that this gets us away from having to have a reward currency oh yeah and maybe I'd be interested if you can elaborate on that a little bit so just um what would the typical role of a reward currency would be and how does this sort of how does the the framework that you're proposing change that right yeah so really I'd back off and say you know what changes this is the active inference point of view right so quote unquote typically if you're doing something like um if you're someone like Yale Neve or Sam gershman then you think about reward as in a reinforcement learning terms as something that the brain has to maximize and then you would say all right well I want the uncertainty of my beliefs to be minimized while I maximize reward so those are then two separate modular computations that have almost opposite goals one of them is to minimize uncertainty right now and the other is to maximize reward over the long term and incomes you know active inference and really says no no if you phrase this as a variational optimization problem then you can get a unified objective for this where you know the common currency is so to speak um evidence really you know evidence that you're following the correct trajectory evidence that you're executing a behavior correct trade and evidence series you know in terms of I guess we would call them gnats or bits are the units and information Theory so if you're using you know e as the basis of your logarithm then it's not if you're using a log 2 base it's bits my dogs are getting picked up for their walks so yes this is a very interesting complementary perspective where we'll get reward maximization over time when we increase our Precision now everybody agrees on that and is it going to be the cart before the horse or the horse before the car and which one's the horse and which one's the cart and framing the unified objective function in information theoretic terms as a surprisal bounding heuristic as has been done in Bayesian evidence lower bounds for a long time by Framing surprise minimization bounding as the unified objective function and currency then there is the realized maintenance of homeostasis or however we want to call that without needing a traditionally structured maximization of reward as defined by a reward or time discounted reward function and it's also very uh interesting like we're not trying to accumulate body temperature we're not trying to accumulate glucose if we were playing a game where simply more points were better like some social and sub-social games then a unilateral optimization via maximization Paradigm makes a lot of sense but for the kind of physiological infinite games that we play as you highlighted with the infinite Horizon then it may make more sense to have a bounded responsibility and an emphasis on controllability under inherited priors that those controllable ranges are the survivable ranges otherwise how could one have existed for Generations rather than try to Stack Up glucose yeah so I think it's always really interesting to go back and read Peter Sterling in this light because you know beyond just the formal physiological material there are these stories that he can tell of for instance people living in long-term stressful situations and they develop what we would Now call the diseases of civilization which you know you Sterling sort of implies are the diseases of homeostasis living too much the same too much of the time and indeed speaking of you know not wanting to stack up glucose this is that you know this is an actual disease that happens to people that is called diabetes it is considered a pathology and so there's almost an interesting you know Misfit between that intuitive notion of reward or at least let's sneer slightly and say that economic notion of reward which has to be a form of accumulative wealth in a common currency versus physiology in which too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing again right and and that actually comes back to if you there's a part of what this is contributing then right in one ways is a sort of shift in metaphor right or it's I think that point about a an economic conception and value and of reward is it's useful to have a Counterpoint to that because as Eli is saying there is no upper limit to economic reward there's a benefit to accumulating it you think about sort of accumulating Capital to spend it um in this case right what what we're focusing on is how to basically keep balanced and adaptable so that future challenges can be actually encountered and dealt with and that sometimes means packing light not keeping so much glucose on hand so that you can very like deal with the reward or deal with changing circumstances and adapt to them but you can't um it's actually it's maybe yeah it's it's maybe been a pretty serious problem to have this completely abstracted notion of value that um is endlessly accumulatable and doesn't actually doesn't interface with any of the biological realities of um of what systems are actually doing right there's yeah it's it's it's so it's so abstract that it's um it's it's gonna have a really hard time interfacing with Biology yeah before we go to the question let's say let's sum that up by saying bank accounts are unbounded and they're useful because they're unbounded you know the account like an economist can conceive of trillions of dollars in assets in a way that my body cannot bodies are bounded if you you know they are physically bounded they are made of a finite amount of matter at once if you try to put too much more into them something bad will happen naturally after setting this up on that channel discussion I've got to duck off a little bit early but I'm going to try to be back for 50.2 next week and I'm really interested to see where this conversation goes so I'll catch up on the hubs thank you um all right thanks if nobody Minds I'd like to ask Dave his question first just because I was about to when I got kicked off yep go for it Dave or um is that one that I said um yeah I know which one that was um if you have a new question it's fine I oh yeah that's probably better um her two pieces of civilization there is the rumor and maybe this was just a fallacy or a misunderstanding that people who managed to stay in London during the blitz under conditions that you would expect would produce massive amount of psycho um psychosomatic disease hysteria conversion syndromes that it didn't happen people were just preposterously sane because they didn't have time to be sick they didn't have time to be crazy did that really happen did the sense of mission override what otherwise would have been General stress syndrome causing breakdowns um does someone know the detailed history of the London Blitz in World War II because I really don't it's a great uh not English dot 1.5 um Journey for us to explore but to to speak to it generally it's an interesting question as well to what extent by comforting and regularizing we even work against that and let alone neglect other trade-offs and incur externalities um Dean Eli this has been fantastic I so here's here's my thing um and I maybe in the in the in the dot two we'll we'll get into the I I mentioned at the end of the dot zero I was I was hoping you really had some really velvet gloves to walk me through the 4.4 because and especially after the context you've been able to provide us today around the idea that [Music] um you know engineers and psychologists came into a room now I don't know if that once you got into that room it became an intersection with red light green light and you guys kind of played a Red Rover come on over thing or weather and you know it so well well here's the thing because I actually did work with CFOs and engineers and and so what you discover is there's a bit of an isomorphist I want to be able to diagram this out for you view that that tends to be biased for engineers and then there's the spatially enveloped view of the psychologist right like they're in their phenomenological space and what you've done is you've tried to say what what when those two worlds come together I don't know if it's a collision I don't know if it's a cooperation it's a variety of things right it's complicated we'll just leave it there but my my question is this as I got to 4.4 it felt like if I was skiing I went from a beautiful powder field to some sparsely um distance trees to Tighter and Tighter and finally I was like I don't know how I can keep going because there doesn't seem to be any more gaps here it's just getting too tight for me and the reconciliation like when you're skiing as a metaphor is you're not looking at the trees you're looking at the at the non thing it's the non-objects it's a Reconciliation and when we're talking about dodgeball as your metaphor or whether we're talking about glucagon control these to me what you were describing up until that point was essentially you were saying for us to know what's going on we're going to look at the risk management we're going to look at the coordination we're going to look at those things that are essentially backwards facing we can say that in order for the process to carry forward continue there has to be some addressing of those factors and then there has to be the reconciliation just like when the engineers and the psychologists are proximal to one another it's an entanglement and and it's not a the engineers get to tell the psychologists what to do any more than the psychologists get to tell the engineers what to do right so if if the behavioral piece if the idea of the biology and the physiology is if I do this now in real terms I have to look at that and you guys had an L4 different time frames right I can manage that you spoke clearly to that I I I read that and it was clear to me I was I I got it I can coordinate that and again that was very very clear and then I got to 4.4 and I simply lost the thread because what I was looking for was the reconciliation I will align this next move with the range recapitulator that's what I was expecting next and then so I went okay so where is the strategy because that's there when when psychologists and engineers get into a room they don't just abandon their strategy it comes with them it follows them into that space and carries them to that question of I reconcile an advantage and all of the above until I choose this Choice while always keeping all the above so you guys talked about that in other parts of it you said we can't just abandon it but I couldn't understand how the formalism reconciled it so I'm sorry that's such a long-winded question but picture paper oh it's awesome to spend six hours of my life going these guys have got to be much closer to answering this because I've never been able to answer it but then I got lost and I just felt like oh man what am I missing okay so I'm gonna disappoint you slightly and say you know what you're missing is that I think what's missing from our writing is really being clear that we're working under a very unusual set of constraints in how we formulated this model so specifically unlike say Sam gershman Oriel leave or unlike the literature on deep active inference in computers we're assuming that you essentially don't need an extra set of computational ingredients for reinforcement learning so we're saying assuming that you can do only the computational operations known to be involved in predictive processing what can you come up with that will handle a control problem and the answer is this very specific thing with these nastily involved derivations called path integral control and you'll notice that when I was going over those slides I basically said let's just say you can simulate you know possible futures like Possible episode length courses you know courses of future activity and you can evaluate them in terms of your objective function and then you can update them by means of a recognition model or by integrating prediction errors and using predictive coding then how do we build a formalism out of just those and the upside is that this does let us look at the controls literature and say all right this is actually optimal feedback stabilized control we can look at some of the bounded rationality literature in cognitive science and Neuroscience and say our objective function is a free energy that is if you have to penalize how much you change neural firing over time or how much you change your mind and update your beliefs over time because you only have so much metabolic power in your head then we include a penalty term for that and we can say this can all just be done by you know embodied simulation and referent configuration motor control does that mean this is how the brain actually does things of course not you know it does mean that if you want to do your modeling with I think um Andy Clark tends to quote you know Quine and say if you want to do if you have a taste for Desert landscapes then we've given you a computational model that is basically just sanded rocks and as such yes it's something of a hostile environment you know walk without Rhythm you won't detract the worm in the planes of active yeah if you want to live behind the shield wall where we have um TD estimated value functions good for you in the stretched sigmoid with broad variability so stretched that it is flat and plain like but still highly controllable within large bounds that's where we're oscillating yep very interesting it'll be I think great in our lab to pick up a few points from am I the one cutting out again I still see you yeah it's okay yeah you're back all right you flickered a bit okay um in the last minutes we can talk about some ideas from earlier in the paper look at any of the figures and then in the dot two that'll be awesome to really approach the formalism and help Dean on that ski Journey um what would be something to go to in these last minutes yes Dean and just and Eli maybe I'll be able to get a chance to elaborate with this bit more of Jordan in the next one but I'm curious you you you took pains and great at Great Lengths to say look this doesn't map directly onto all the complexities that we know exist but what because you said to start at this in 2019 you had a bit of time on your hands and then and then did kind of alluded this at the beginning were there discoveries that you made that you didn't anticipate because you you were very also very um respectful in who you acknowledged as sort of laying the the groundwork here you had a bit of stability to work off of but did you did you find yourself introduced being introduced to things that weren't there prior to you guys coalescing around this and do you think it continues to evolve or does it just stay on a theoretical level [Music] um so actually I'd say for me personally the big unanticipated Discovery was just how little we know about interceptive neuroanatomy and neurophysiology and I mean in the periphery so you know our lab with Lisa and Karen Lisa handles the stuff above the neck and so we've got you know Barrett and Simmons 2015 there's a number of other good papers saying essentially you look at the brain architecture and it looks like the at least in cortex you know the interceptive and visceral motor cortices are fairly Central to the architecture and then you ask okay so what kinds of signals are coming in from the periphery to then be subjected to predictive processing in cortex and you basically get told well in terreceptive signals obviously so there was that moment when I was working with Karen and realized oh okay so it looks like there's actually this close analogy that we could hypothesize between the known function of a somatomotor circuit for voluntary motor control and this way of handling Barrel reflex function and it looks like for the barrel reflex you know you can voluntarily change the gain or the tolerance those being inverses of each other changing the operating point you know voluntarily doesn't seem to happen but it does seem to shift and it does begin to look as though ah we can just we can stop just saying you know there are interceptive signals we don't know anything about them right and instead ask how could we break down the autonomic nervous system and the interceptive periphery into these you know control circuits where there's a reference that flows from above or is possibly built in as a prior and then a sensor and then a motor neuron or an effector that again total speculating one could imagine that Loop could be ultra local or even get cellular electrical Junctions so as local as could be to close the motor control Loop and then there would be potentially a more meso scale purely within the periphery um maybe some sort of motor coordination or vasoconstriction type actions that are being enacted through local neural networks and other systems and then when you gotta make the call to the central nervous system and engage at that level it's the highest capacity of like Intermodal memory computation all these other complex phenomena which then can be seen to have their rightful place maybe even in a specific brain region but the entire integrated dodgeball performance is not going to be located to a brain region any more than it would be located to a fingertip because it all needs to be coordinated and not every call can be local and not every call can be global so finding out how bodies as territories and our models as Maps wire things up is going to make models that are more interpretable better aligned with empirical data making more useful predictions and explanations it's very interesting angle and I would say just to piggyback a little you know as a modeling Paradigm I think this is one of the real strengths of active inference is that once you're dealing with these probability densities and log probability densities you are able to start sketching out these hierarchical structures and that doesn't mean that every hierarchical active inference model is automatically a map of the nervous system but it does mean that you have a language that is at least minimally capable of expressing what we so abundantly find in the empirical evidence yeah one part of the paper that was very interesting what we in reading it remarked how although most papers are written in words this one was very word forward each section had a preamble content summary sandwiching technique as did the paper at a higher scale the nomenclature was up front and clear and then the relationship between the cumulative distributions and the classical PDF type probability densities was made clear but this exactly connects something that has a um in the generic case a guaranteed inflection point interpretable thresholded values this is why sigmoid functions are used as activation functions in artificial neural networks with a uh optimizable laplacian approximation like inverted quadratic form that is able to be used as a log probability and so really like especially with figure 9 showing the stepwise relationship opens the door to like hey if you've seen a sigmoid somewhere now you can think about that as like a PDF hiding a PDF bell curve and then where you have seen a gaussian or bell curve or a laplacian approximation you can go the other direction and think about that in terms of a sigmoidal response action and so they're rarely connected so clearly though those with familiarity it's almost the water that they swim in and those without familiarity wouldn't see the connection and the The Challenge and the opportunity is like to stick in the middle and stay in the connection space to raise attention to some of these relationships which again otherwise you could have a whole subfield of physiology working on the sigmoid response curve and a whole subfield of hierarchical predictive processing models working in the PDF space or log PDF space and it's just a derivative and a log or an exponentiation and a derivation away from those two Fields being formally connected not just as like a speculative review paper someone could or should do this but like it's done we just didn't know tools so I think regarding the writing I really have to have credit to Lisa and Karen for a lot of things where you know speaking of more speaking of dialectical processes you know we have a very simple writing dialectic on these papers which is Junior author knows math senior authors did not specialize in math in their undergrad or master's degree or key or even PhD however good they are with it now and the result ends up being you know you're always told to go back and explain every single step and of course Jordan you know who was here before was helping a lot with the writing and the structuring and the sign posting and then I think the ins the actual Insight that you can take one of these sigmoids and turn it into a PDF I think came after hammering our heads on some of the embodied predictive processing literature a bunch of times foreign it is one of those things that is literally embodied Dean yeah I just wanted to get this in I I What attracted me to the paper in the first place was was that the Alice case descending and the interception what kept me going back to it was um and we talked about this in the dot zero was wayfinder that rule uh perfect perspective swaps versus away binder when I first started reading this paper I I saw the metamorphosis from identifying a way to find things and now after having this conversation with you today and and Jordan and of course the usual suspects it it it's it's clearer to me that this paper is trying to play that role of being wayfinder perspective identifier as opposed to we found the way or this is this is our way to solve all the world's ills which it of course I don't think it was ever your intention but when you pull things that are seemingly quite far apart like allostasis and interception I get excited but I I don't as you pointed out pump the brake steam don't get too excited here I mean we're doing the best we can so on that level uh my amygdala is still functioning correctly in our closing Thoughts with a driving example are we accumulating speed or minimizing the amount of time or our speed limits even set as exteriorized right norms and stigmergic marks on the niche such that a variety of cars from a sports car to a 18-wheeler can be within a zone of optimal controllability taking into account the presence of crosswalks and so on and so alongside as we think about what we want to explore in the dot two alongside diving into formalisms trying to do some excavation and interception on how and where the economic optimization as maximization is implicitly used and where some of these other Notions that were being raised without needing to be polemical or replace value maximization but where we can see these other survivability Criterion as potentially different decompositions of unified objective functions that are informational and so on I think that's going to be quite far-ranging because there's more situations I would venture where we would rather have controllability and expectation bounding and meeting rather than Point stacking so final comments you like yeah so I just really want to close by re-emphasizing that we don't you know we're not I think I have this joke on my Twitter profile abolish the value function and that's really just a pun for the people who can get it but you know we're not trying to tell people contrary to their subjective experience oh you don't really have you know value in your brain there's actually just you know trying to track your reference trajectory so in the 0.2 we can talk about you know which specific kinds of feedback control what kinds of feedback mechanisms are really being spoken of in this paper and I think as you know preview it's negative both negative in the sense of avoiding negative reinforcement and in the sense of trying to flatten out a response function and be able to proportionally respond so you know with the benefit of hindsight this paper is going to have a pretty limited you know domain of application but it's helpful in that it gives us a language to turn around to the ex to the empiricists and say this is what we want to actually look for any closing comments otherwise that's a great note well Eli and Jordan as well thanks for coming out and for engaging in dot Winery and we'll see you next week thanks guys see you next week
