# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Darius Parvis Wayne discusses the complexities of temporality, subjective time, and active inference in a live stream presentation.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Darius Parvis Wayne presents his paper on temporality and active inference.
2. He clarifies his focus is on subjective time, not objective time.
3. The paper discusses various philosophical theories regarding time's nature.
4. Wayne introduces the concept of "passage phenomenology" regarding time flow.
5. Subjective time is influenced by retention and protention in conscious experience.
6. Flow states are characterized by rapid hypothesis updating and perceptual changes.
7. The relationship between action policies and temporal flow is explored.
8. Distinctions between static and dynamic predictability regarding time perception are made.
9. The paper proposes that flow states lead to faster perceived time passage.
10. Future research is suggested to empirically examine time perception across different contexts.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Subjective time is complex and influenced by cognitive processes like retention and protention.
2. Flow states alter the perception of time, making it feel faster.
3. Active inference is a useful framework for understanding temporal experiences.
4. The interplay between objective and subjective time is crucial for understanding consciousness.
5. Future empirical research could further elucidate the dynamics of time perception.
