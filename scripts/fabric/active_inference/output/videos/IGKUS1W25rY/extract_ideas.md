# IDEAS

- Active Inference Lab promotes online team communication focused on active inference discussions.
- Live stream discussions are recorded and archived for future reference and feedback.
- All perspectives are welcomed in the discussions to enhance collaborative learning.
- Scheduled meetings for December 2020 focus on topics like "scripts" and "sophisticated effective inference."
- Participants introduce themselves and share their backgrounds to foster a collaborative environment.
- Discussions explore the concept of scripts and their role in social interactions and frameworks.
- The transparency of active inference is compared to black box models in deep learning.
- The impact of losing scripts in social interactions raises questions about identity and behavior.
- The relationship between personal scripts and external influences is a key theme in discussions.
- Understanding the context and types of scripts can enhance communication and social dynamics.
- The notion of free energy is tied to policy selection and behavior regulation in active inference.
- Active inference frameworks aim to unify various dimensions of scripts, including internal and external factors.
- Participants reflect on how scripts shape their daily routines and social behaviors.
- The influence of props, such as chairs, on social interactions and scripts is discussed.
- Masks symbolize how identities and scripts change in different social contexts, especially in the current climate.
- The challenge of interpreting observations and managing uncertainty is central to effective data collection.
- Morning routines serve as an example of how scripts can be habitual yet flexible in practice.
- Participants explore the potential of engineering social behavior through understanding and modifying scripts.
- The need for clarity in distinguishing what constitutes a script versus other social constructs is emphasized.
- Future discussions will focus on applying active inference concepts to real-world challenges and script engineering.
- The excitement of exploring active inference and scripts leads to possibilities for enhancing social interactions and freedoms.
