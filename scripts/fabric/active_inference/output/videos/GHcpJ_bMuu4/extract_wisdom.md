- Engaging with the community allows for real-time feedback on academic papers to improve understanding.
- The paper emphasizes the need for clarity in distinguishing between mathematical and empirical claims.
- Variational inference is more familiar to physicists and machine learning practitioners than to philosophers.
- Free energy serves as a measure of inaccuracy in belief systems, impacting decision-making processes.
- The active inference framework can inform practices in coaching and decision support systems.
- The integration of action and inference in active inference is essential for understanding cognitive dynamics.
- Teaching complex topics requires balancing clarity and depth to avoid overwhelming learners.
- The guide format allows for iterative improvement based on community feedback and engagement.
- Philosophy and mathematics can coexist, but they often require careful navigation to bridge gaps.
- Engaging with the community fosters collaboration and enriches the development of scientific theories.
- Acknowledging the evolution of theories is essential for maintaining relevance in scientific discussions.

- Engaging the community in academic discussions enhances understanding and promotes collaborative learning.
- The distinction between inference and action is fundamental in active inference theory.
- A clear interpretation of mathematical functions can facilitate philosophical discussions in cognitive science.
- Emphasizing the iterative nature of scientific inquiry encourages openness to new ideas and adaptations.
- Balancing theoretical rigor with practical applications is vital for impactful research.
- Philosophers should engage with mathematical concepts to enrich their understanding of cognitive science.
- The guide format allows for a structured approach to learning while remaining adaptable to new insights.
- Addressing misconceptions in scientific literature fosters clearer communication and deeper understanding.
- Continuous feedback loops improve the quality and accessibility of academic work.

# QUOTES:
- "This paper came about because we... had been in discussions around a symposium discussing active inference."
- "We hope it will stop them from getting scared of all the complicated mathematics."
- "One thing that I noticed in reading the literature was that different kinds of claims were being conflated."
- "The key thing we want philosophers to sort of have in their minds is the relationship between variational inference and Bayesian inference."
- "What I'm really interested in hearing from everyone else today is comments and suggestions."
- "The simple answer is just it will help them understand what Friston is claiming."
- "What I think we've done by describing free energy is trading off that sort of ability to enter into understanding the maths."
- "One of the big revelations was that you can talk about variational inference without talking about Markov blankets."
- "You have to assume that what you're starting with is simplicity."
- "We're all helping each other to do that."
- "It's not true that science intends to represent things that way."
- "There's a sense in which things are still being worked out."
- "The relationship between the philosophical audience and the math that was used to get us to this place."
- "The nature of preferences starts to have a way where they can both live together."
- "We're trying to show that some things could be evaluated very directly."
- "If you threw out minimizing variational free energy, you'd have to admit that you're wrong about that approach."
