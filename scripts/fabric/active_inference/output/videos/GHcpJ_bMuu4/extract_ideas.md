# IDEAS

- Active Inference Lab promotes participatory online learning and practice of applied active inference.
- The goal of the live stream is to discuss Stephen Mann's paper on free energy.
- The paper aims to bridge the gap between mathematics and philosophy in active inference.
- Collaborations among authors began from discussions at a symposium in 2018.
- The paper focuses on making complex mathematics accessible to philosophers.
- Active inference is related to variational inference and Bayesian inference in cognitive science.
- Philosophers often conflate different claims in literature; the paper seeks to clarify these distinctions.
- Variational inference is more familiar to physicists, statisticians, and machine learning practitioners than philosophers.
- The paper aims to help philosophers understand the relationship between different types of inference.
- The authors emphasize the importance of disentangling claims made in the literature.
- The introduction of action into the active inference framework is a key focus of the discussion.
- The authors express interest in understanding the implications of their work in applied contexts.
- The complexity of mathematical models can create barriers for philosophers in understanding active inference.
- The authors hope to provide a foundational understanding of active inference for future discussions.
- The relationship between empirical claims and mathematical claims in cognitive science is explored.
- The authors aim to provide a clear introduction to the free energy principle and its implications.
- The paper addresses the challenges of presenting complex ideas in an accessible manner.
- The iterative process of feedback on the paper aims to improve its clarity and effectiveness.
- The distinctions between generative models and recognition models are discussed in the context of inference.
- Philosophers need to engage with the mathematical components of active inference for a deeper understanding.
- The authors express a desire for ongoing dialogue and feedback from the philosophical community.
- The idea of a "guide" in academia is discussed in terms of its accessibility and utility for learners.
- The dynamic nature of knowledge and its implications for active inference practice are emphasized.
- The authors reflect on the balance between stability and adaptability in guiding principles for active inference.
- The exploration of preferences and probabilities in active inference is a key area of interest for future research.
- The concept of "fitness" in active inference is connected to decision-making and adaptive behavior.
- The authors highlight the importance of clarity in distinguishing between different types of claims in the literature.
- The philosophical implications of active inference and its applications in various fields are acknowledged.
- The discussion emphasizes the value of collaboration and feedback in academic research and discourse.
