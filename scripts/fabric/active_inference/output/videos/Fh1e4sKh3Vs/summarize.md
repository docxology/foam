# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Thomas Ringstrom presents a compositional theory of self-preserving agents that emphasizes empowerment gain maximization over traditional reward systems.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Presentation focuses on empowerment gain maximization for self-preserving agents.
2. Traditional reward maximization objectives pose significant issues for agent planning.
3. Agents operate in high-dimensional product spaces with complex internal and external states.
4. Structured core ontologies are crucial for maintaining controllability in agents.
5. State time feasibility functions help map initial states to goals effectively.
6. Decomposing hierarchical state spaces enhances flexible planning capabilities.
7. Operator Bellman equations facilitate probabilistic reasoning without relying on rewards.
8. Empowerment serves as an intrinsic motivation metric based on controllability.
9. Valence functions can assess the value of state transitions and actions.
10. Future research aims to integrate findings into computational neuroscience and AI.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Empowerment, rather than reward, could better drive intelligent agent behavior.
2. Decomposing complex state spaces aids in efficient planning and decision-making.
3. Understanding the dynamics of agent-environment coupling is essential for AI development.
4. Valence provides a useful framework for evaluating agent actions and states.
5. Future work should focus on combining empowerment with generative models in AI.
