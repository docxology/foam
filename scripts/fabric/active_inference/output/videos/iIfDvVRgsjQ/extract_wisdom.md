# SUMMARY
The Actin Lab livestream discusses "Thinking Like a State," focusing on state intelligence and active inference, featuring insights from researchers Aval Guinin, Stephen, Daniel, and Blue.

# IDEAS:
- States can be viewed as hierarchical control systems akin to brain architecture.
- Collective cognitive agency emerges from the deep history of early state societies.
- Active inference grounds the study of intelligence in maintaining structural autonomy.
- Intelligence is the ability to link data and build understanding through adaptive behavior.
- Autonomous systems are defined by processes that sustain their identity and operational closure.
- Niche construction is crucial for cumulative cultural evolution and societal adaptability.
- Dense settlements allow for economic interdependence and functional specialization in societies.
- The state's grip requires perceived competency and legitimacy among its population.
- Legal codes transcribe administrative expectations into individual behavior, shaping societal norms.
- The collective mind operates through slower dynamical constraints, not just individual interactions.
- The state mediates socio-cultural expectations, influencing individual cognitive processes.
- The evolution of cities reflects adaptive strategies to manage environmental and social complexities.
- Collective brains emerge from the interaction of many individual cognitive processes.
- Urban systems function as basic life forms, maintaining their identity through metabolic flows.
- Writing technologies enable long-term expectations and collective memory in societal contexts.
- The notion of shared identity is crucial for understanding state formation and factionalism.
- The state's administrative systems standardize understanding and manipulation of its socio-cultural niche.
- Active inference allows systems to adapt and maximize evidence for their world models.
- Autonomy in states is tied to their capacity to recreate and maintain structural identity.
- The relationship between states and technology shapes modern governance and citizen control.
- Understanding state dynamics is essential for addressing current social and political challenges.

# INSIGHTS:
- The concept of intelligence should encompass diverse cognitive abilities across different life forms.
- States can be modeled as information-processing machines that enact collective intelligence.
- Understanding niche construction provides insights into the evolution of societal structures.
- The historical context of state emergence is vital for analyzing contemporary governance.
- Effective governance relies on both the perception of legitimacy and structural competency.
- Laws serve as normative guidelines that shape individual behavior within the societal framework.
- The collective mind transcends individual cognition, forming a network of interrelated processes.
- Technological advancements have transformed the ways states exert control and influence.
- The interplay between societal norms and individual actions reflects a dynamic cognitive landscape.
- Engaging with historical perspectives can enhance our understanding of current state dynamics.

# QUOTES:
- "States can be and should be understood as hierarchical control systems essentially similar in their core physical architecture to brains."
- "Intelligent etymologically is the capacity to make links to connect dots of data."
- "Autonomy refers to the property of operational closure under precarious circumstances."
- "Embodied intelligence refers to the ability for understanding adaptation imprinted in an agent's physical structure."
- "Active inference conceives of cognition as synchronization across individuated sensory motor states."
- "The emergence of city-states constitutes a clear case of evolutionary transition."
- "Basic autonomy is formally defined as operational closure, maintaining and recreating itself."
- "The cognitive activity of states is defined mechanically by standardized administrative systems."
- "The institution of state-sponsored legal codes affords a way to directly transcribe administrative expectations."
- "Cultural niche construction allowed humans to alter their social cognitive ecology."
- "The collective mind does not directly emerge from inter-individual interactions but from slower evolving dynamical constraints."
- "The proper scale of analysis of collective cognition is an integrated activity of entire urban systems."
- "Our notion of intelligence is based upon active inference, a scale-free framework applying to any system."
- "Niche construction is critical for cumulative cultural evolution and advancements."
- "The state's grip requires building acceptance into the population through perceived competency."

# HABITS:
- Maintain a consistent schedule for participatory discussions to facilitate engagement.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration to enrich discussions and insights.
- Encourage feedback loops to improve the quality of future sessions.
- Utilize active inference principles in daily decision-making processes.
- Engage with historical texts to better understand contemporary state dynamics.
- Regularly reflect on the implications of legal codes in daily life.
- Explore how technology alters personal and societal interactions.
- Prioritize understanding the role of shared identity in community dynamics.
- Practice clear communication to convey complex ideas effectively.
- Seek diverse perspectives to enrich discussions on cognitive agency.

# FACTS:
- The concept of "active inference" provides a framework for understanding cognitive processes.
- Historical societies have theorized about states for thousands of years.
- The emergence of states is often linked to agricultural and trade practices.
- Cognitive agency can be distributed across networks, not just within individuals.
- Writing technologies have significantly shaped cultural evolution and societal structures.
- The interplay between state control and individual autonomy is a key area of study.
- Urban systems can be analyzed through the lens of basic life forms.
- Collective intelligence emerges from the interaction of individual cognitive processes.
- The evolution of societal structures reflects adaptive strategies to environmental challenges.
- Administrative systems standardize how states manage and understand their world.
