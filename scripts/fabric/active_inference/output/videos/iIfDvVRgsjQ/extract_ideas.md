# IDEAS

- Actinflab is a participatory online lab focused on applied active inference and collective learning.
- The upcoming discussions will cover the paper "Thinking Like a State" by Aval Guinin Kalu.
- Participants are encouraged to provide feedback to improve the lab's work and discussions.
- Active inference provides a new lens for understanding long-standing questions about societies and states.
- Social topographies explore how state and niche construction influence individual experiences and architecture.
- The paper aims to understand how states have historically constituted and their structural identity over time.
- States are hierarchical control systems similar to brains, maintaining structural autonomy through active inference.
- Intelligence is the capacity to make connections and understand the world through ecological activity.
- Autonomy refers to a system's ability to maintain its identity through collective processes without external forces.
- The concept of embodied intelligence connects adaptation understanding to an agent's physical structure.
- Active inference integrates cognition with sensory-motor states and minimizes expected variational free energy over time.
- Niche construction modifies environments to fit ecological needs, influencing cognitive development and expectations.
- The collective brain hypothesis posits that societies act as collective cognitive agents through shared cultural learning.
- Urban systems manage to minimize variational free energy by maintaining their structural identity through systemic regulation.
- Shared identity within states can lead to factionalism and potential conflicts, questioning the stability of such identities.
- The emergence of states is tied to agriculture, trade, and the centralization of resources and power.
- The state's grip on individuals is maintained through perceived competency and symbolic legitimacy, such as laws and norms.
- Collective cognition emerges from the nested hierarchy of regulation systems, enhancing adaptive behavior at a larger scale.
- The cognitive activity of states is mechanically defined by administrative systems and their drive to manipulate their environment.
- Understanding state mechanisms can inform strategies for navigating contemporary social and political landscapes.
