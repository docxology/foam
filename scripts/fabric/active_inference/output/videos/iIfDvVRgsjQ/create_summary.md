# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The live stream discusses the paper "Thinking Like a State," exploring active inference, state emergence, and collective cognitive dynamics in urban systems.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The Actin Flab is a participatory online lab focusing on applied active inference.
2. The paper discusses states as hierarchical control systems similar to brains.
3. Active inference grounds the study of collective intelligence in urban systems.
4. Cities and states evolve through cultural niche construction and socio-cognitive ecology.
5. Shared identity and administrative systems shape state functionality and grip over populations.
6. Writing and technology facilitate the emergence of collective cognition in societies.
7. States require economic co-dependency and functional specialization for stability.
8. The relationship between individual cognition and collective agency is crucial for understanding states.
9. Structural constraints play a significant role in maintaining a state's autonomy and identity.
10. The study of urban systems reveals insights into the intelligence displayed by city-state systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. States can be analyzed as complex systems with hierarchical structures akin to cognitive processes.
2. The concept of active inference provides a framework to understand collective intelligence in societies.
3. Cultural niche construction is fundamental to the evolution of urban systems and state emergence.
4. Understanding shared identity is critical to addressing issues of factionalism and state stability.
5. Future discussions can deepen insights into the relationship between cognitive agency and societal structures.
