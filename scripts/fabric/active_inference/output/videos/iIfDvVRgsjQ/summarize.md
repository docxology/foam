# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Actin Lab's livestream discusses the paper "Thinking Like a State," exploring state dynamics through the lens of active inference and collective cognition.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Actin Lab is a participatory online platform for discussing applied active inference.
2. The paper examines how states function as hierarchical control systems similar to brains.
3. Collective cognitive agency emerges from cultural niche construction and functional specialization.
4. States maintain structural identity through economic co-dependency and social institutions.
5. Active inference grounds the study of intelligence and autonomy in collective brain theories.
6. Urban systems manage their environments to minimize expected variational free energy.
7. The institutionalization of legal codes influences individual behavior and societal norms.
8. Shared identity and expectations contribute to state legitimacy and control.
9. The historical evolution of states is shaped by agriculture, writing, and socio-cultural dynamics.
10. Understanding state dynamics can inform future research on collective cognition and active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. States operate as complex systems, similar to biological brains, managing resources and behaviors.
2. Collective cognition is grounded in the interplay of individual actions and broader societal constraints.
3. The evolution of states is intertwined with technological advancements and cultural practices.
4. Active inference provides a framework for understanding how states adapt and maintain autonomy.
5. Recognizing the significance of shared identity can help address contemporary societal divisions.
