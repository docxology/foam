# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Actin Flab's livestream discusses Majeed Benny's paper on modularity, free energy, and cognitive architectures in active inference.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Actin Flab promotes participatory learning in active inference, welcoming diverse perspectives.
2. The livestream focuses on Majeed Benny's paper about modularity and free energy.
3. The discussion emphasizes the importance of scientific models in understanding cognitive architectures.
4. Benny defends a modest version of modularity against critiques from Hippolyto and Kirchoff.
5. Modularity is linked to information encapsulation and its implications for cognitive science.
6. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and directed cyclic models (DCMs) serve different modeling purposes.
7. The free energy principle (FEP) is critiqued for lacking detail on brain mechanisms.
8. Benny argues that DCMs support a moderate form of modularity without complete isolation.
9. The significance of scale in Markov blankets is debated in the context of modularity.
10. The livestream encourages feedback for continuous improvement in discussions and participation.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active participation in discussions enhances learning and understanding of complex topics.
2. Modularity in cognitive science is nuanced and requires careful consideration of its definitions.
3. Different modeling approaches (DAGs vs. DCMs) are context-dependent and should be chosen based on goals.
4. The relationship between scientific models and theoretical frameworks shapes our understanding of cognition.
5. Engaging in philosophical discussions can enrich scientific inquiry and interpretation of findings.
