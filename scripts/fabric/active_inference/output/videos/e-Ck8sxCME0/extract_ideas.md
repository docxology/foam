# IDEAS

- ActinFlab is an online lab focused on applied active inference and participatory learning.
- The live stream discusses the paper "A Tale of Two Architectures" by Majeed Benny.
- The session emphasizes the importance of feedback for improving the lab's efforts.
- Participants from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to contribute to discussions and learning.
- The focus is on the implications of modularity in cognitive architectures and predictive processing.
- Modularity can refer to various concepts, including functional, effective, and anatomical aspects.
- The Markov blanket concept is central to understanding modularity and active inference.
- Benny's paper defends a model-based view of cognitive modularity against critiques from Hippolito and Kirchhoff.
- The paper argues that modularity is essential for scientific practice and understanding cognition.
- The discussion includes different types of graphical models, including Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Directed Cyclic Models (DCMs).
- Dags are computationally efficient while DCMs allow for feedback loops in modeling.
- The paper critiques the assumption that modularity undermines the free energy principle (FEP).
- FEP integrates cognitive processes through prediction and action, challenging traditional views of modularity.
- The relationship between modularity and FEP is explored through the lens of scientific models.
- The paper emphasizes the need for a pragmatic approach to model selection in neuroscience.
- Critiques of modularity often stem from misunderstanding its practical applications in cognitive neuroscience.
- The concept of encapsulation in modularity is debated, with implications for cognitive function and neuroscience.
- The importance of scientific models in understanding modularity and cognitive systems is highlighted.
- Benny argues for a modest interpretation of modularity that retains its significance in cognitive science.
- The discussion reflects on the interplay between philosophical positions and scientific modeling practices.
- The paper concludes with the idea that modularity remains relevant in the context of scientific models and practices.
