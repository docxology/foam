- Modularity encompasses the functional segregation of cognition, influencing how we design cognitive architectures.  
- Informational encapsulation within modularity restricts subsystems from accessing data from other compartments during processing.  
- The relationship between modularity and the free energy principle (FEP) is significant for cognitive science development.  
- Markov blankets highlight the conditional independence of internal and external states in predictive architectures.  
- Dynamic causal models (DCMs) provide insights into effective connectivity, contrasting with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  
- The debate on modularity emphasizes the role of scientific models in understanding brain functions and architectures.  
- Modularity in neuroscience can be viewed through various lenses, including functional, effective, and anatomical perspectives.  
- The interaction between predictive coding and cognitive capacities suggests a deeper relationship in understanding cognition.  
- Scientific models serve as a bridge between theoretical frameworks and empirical systems, shaping our understanding of reality.  
- The choice of models in scientific practice reflects operational pragmatism rather than metaphysical commitments.  
- Critiques of modularity highlight its importance while acknowledging its limitations in explaining complex cognitive processes.  
- Engaging in debates around modularity fosters collaborative growth in scientific understanding and methodological advancements.  
- The dynamic nature of information processing in the brain challenges traditional notions of static modularity.  
- Embracing a deflationary approach to modularity allows for flexibility in scientific interpretations and applications.  
- Understanding the scale-friendly nature of Markov blankets can enhance our grasp of cognitive architecture.  
- The interplay of different scientific models encourages a more nuanced view of cognitive systems and their functionalities.
