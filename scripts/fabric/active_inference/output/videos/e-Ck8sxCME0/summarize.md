# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
ActinFlab's livestream discusses Majeed Benny's paper on modularity, free energy principle, and their implications for cognitive architecture.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. ActinFlab focuses on participatory online learning about active inference and cognitive architecture.
2. The livestream discusses Benny's paper "A Tale of Two Architectures."
3. Modularity in cognitive systems can refer to information encapsulation and segregation.
4. The free energy principle (FEP) is a key framework for understanding cognition.
5. Benny argues against Hippolyto and Kirchoff's critiques of the modularity thesis.
6. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and directed cyclic models (DCMs) are complementary modeling tools.
7. Modularity's relevance is tied to how scientific models are employed in research.
8. Markov blankets help conceptualize the interaction between internal and external states.
9. Scientific models should be recognized for their situational and operational roles in research.
10. The debate on modularity remains significant for understanding cognitive architecture and neuroscience.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Engaging with diverse perspectives enriches discussions on complex cognitive theories.
2. Understanding modularity's role in cognition helps frame scientific inquiries effectively.
3. Scientific models are essential for articulating theories and facilitating research.
4. The relationship between models and modularity influences interpretations of cognitive processes.
5. Active participation in discussions fosters collaborative learning and knowledge advancement.
