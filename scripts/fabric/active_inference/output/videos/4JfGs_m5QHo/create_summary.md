# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The livestream discusses a paper on how bioelectricity drives multicellularity and cognition through evolutionary processes and computational frameworks.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Lab focuses on participatory learning and applied active inference.
2. The paper explores how bioelectricity influences multicellularity and cognition.
3. Individuals are defined by their ability to pursue goals at different scales.
4. Homeostasis evolves into predictive allostasis for better environmental adaptation.
5. Information sharing through gap junctions enhances cognitive integration among cells.
6. Cancer represents a return to simpler computational boundaries of individual cells.
7. Infotaxis encourages cells to cooperate for better information about their environment.
8. The paper proposes a unifying framework for understanding cognitive systems across scales.
9. Predictions include developing bioelectric communication technology and inducing multicellular forms.
10. The concept of “self” is challenged, highlighting the interdependence of cognitive agents.

# TAKEAWAYS:
