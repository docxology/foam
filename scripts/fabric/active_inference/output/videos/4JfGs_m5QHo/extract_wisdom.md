# SUMMARY
The Acton Flab livestream, hosted by Blue and Daniel, discusses Mike Levin's paper on bioelectricity, multicellularity, and cognition.

# IDEAS:
- The paper explores bioelectricity's role in cognition across different biological scales and systems.
- It proposes a definition of individuals based on goal-oriented capacities across various agents.
- Developmental bioelectricity facilitates communication and cognition in multicellular organisms through electrical networks.
- The research links evolutionary biology with cognitive science, offering insights into agency and goal-directedness.
- Cognitive boundaries are defined by how agents perceive and influence their environment through time.
- Cancer is viewed as a reversible breakdown of multicellularity, emphasizing the importance of communication.
- The concept of infotaxis suggests that organisms seek information to enhance their adaptive capabilities.
- Evolutionary processes can be understood through the lens of cognitive integration and information flow.
- The idea of a cognitive light cone illustrates how agents' abilities to measure and act vary over time.
- Multicellular systems showcase emergent properties that arise from the interplay between individual cells and their environments.
- The study highlights the significance of gap junctions in facilitating intercellular communication and collective behavior.
- Active inference provides a framework for understanding how agents minimize surprise and optimize their actions.
- The concept of homeostasis evolves into predictive allostasis, allowing organisms to anticipate environmental changes.
- Memory is posited as a key element in cognitive processes and decision-making across biological systems.
- There are implications for artificial intelligence, suggesting that intelligent components may need to pursue their own goals.
- The research calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to explore the implications of bioelectricity in various fields.

# INSIGHTS:
