# IDEAS

- The discussion focuses on psychedelics, specifically the 5HT2A receptor and its relation to active inference.
- Psychedelics' impact on neurotransmitter systems, especially serotonin and dopamine, is largely unexplored in machine learning.
- Dopamine is associated with external focus, while serotonin may promote internal focus and patience.
- The 5HT2A receptor has high activation thresholds, influencing mood and cognitive processes.
- Classic psychedelics are categorized based on their structural precursors, primarily tryptamine and phenylethylamine.
- Machine learning models can potentially incorporate insights from neurotransmitter systems to enhance decision-making parameters.
- The relationship between dopamine and serotonin can be viewed through the lens of balance and complementarity.
- Serotonin's role in enhancing patience contrasts with dopamine's association with impulsivity.
- The 1A and 2A serotonin receptors exhibit different effects on neuronal signaling and coping responses.
- Active inference utilizes dopamine and serotonin as parameters for policy selection and cognitive processes.
- The Rebus paradigm explains the relaxing of beliefs under psychedelics, enhancing perception and consciousness.
- The Albus model extends Rebus by introducing the concept of strengthening beliefs alongside relaxing them.
- Traveling waves in the brain might play a significant role in perception and cognitive processing.
- The temporal window of conscious awareness may be limited to around three seconds in human experience.
- Creativity and memory are intricately linked, with different types of creativity influencing recall accuracy.
- The relationship between psychedelics and sensory deprivation highlights their effects on perception and consciousness.
- Ants and other collective organisms operate under different cognitive frameworks, emphasizing the role of the collective.
- The dynamics of self-awareness and ego can vary significantly across species and developmental stages.
- The ego serves both as a necessary perspective for agency and as a potential source of cognitive distortion.
- Psychedelics can reveal core priors and influence the balance between subjective experience and objective reality.
- The neurobiological basis for creativity and perception may involve complex interactions among various receptor systems.
- Exploring the similarities and differences in cognitive systems across species can reveal insights into consciousness and perception.
