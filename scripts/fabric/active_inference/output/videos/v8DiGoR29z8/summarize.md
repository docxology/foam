# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter 3 explores Markov blankets and their implications on the relationship between internal states and external environments in living systems.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Chapter 3 contrasts a high road approach with Chapter 2's bottom-up method.
2. The Markov blanket separates internal states from external environments in systems.
3. Internal states are influenced indirectly by external states, not directly.
4. Markov blankets help model living and artificial life systems, including xenobots.
5. Nonlinear causal structures benefit from Markov blankets for understanding complex dynamics.
6. Active inference emphasizes agency and decision-making based on prior beliefs.
7. The relationship between affordances and actions is crucial in modeling behavior.
8. Free will is debated in the context of agency and prior beliefs in decision-making.
9. Variational free energy and maximum entropy principles are relevant in risk management.
10. The chapter highlights the need for generative models to understand complex systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Markov blankets are essential for modeling the interaction between internal and external states.
2. The relationship between prior beliefs and decision-making influences perceptions of free will.
3. Nonlinear dynamics require a deeper understanding of Markov blankets for accurate modeling.
4. Active inference provides a framework for understanding agency in systems.
5. The interplay between variational free energy and maximum entropy informs risk management strategies.
