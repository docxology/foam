IDEAS

- The active inference lab focuses on applied active inference and its application to empirical data.
- The tutorial paper by Smith et al. is a step-by-step guide on active inference.
- The session is designed for individuals with limited mathematical background interested in active inference.
- Active inference models are more complex than traditional reinforcement learning models.
- The session aims to make active inference more accessible by providing background and example code.
- Understanding MATLAB is essential for using the provided tutorial code effectively.
- Active inference allows for both parameter exploration and state exploration in decision-making.
- The concept of expected free energy is central to understanding active inference models.
- The reward and information value components of expected free energy facilitate exploration-exploitation tasks.
- Active inference provides a unified framework for modeling various types of decision-making tasks.
- The neural process theory associated with active inference predicts specific neural responses in studies.
- Coding examples in the tutorial allow users to replicate experiments and adjust parameters easily.
- The tutorial includes both theoretical explanations and practical coding examples for active inference.
