# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion explores how canonical neural networks perform active inference, linking neurodynamics with statistical inference and biological optimization.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Institute promotes applied active inference discussions and learning in neural networks.
2. Canonical neural networks optimize internal representations of their environment to minimize future risks.
3. The paper establishes a correspondence between neural network dynamics and variational Bayesian inference.
4. Active inference incorporates both perceptual learning and action-oriented behavior for survival adaptation.
5. A generative model is essential for understanding sensory input and decision-making in neural networks.
6. Delayed modulation of synaptic plasticity enhances neural networks' ability to minimize risk.
7. The complete class theorem links any neural network minimizing a cost function to Bayesian inference.
8. Empirical data can reconstruct generative models underlying neural networks for predictive learning.
9. The maze task simulations illustrate active inference in neural networks through adaptive decision-making.
10. Variational free energy minimization characterizes the neural networkâ€™s learning and decision-making process.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding neural networks requires exploring their optimization processes and active inference mechanisms.
2. Active inference provides a framework for linking perception and action within neural systems.
3. The equivalence between neural networks and Bayesian inference enhances explainability in neural computations.
