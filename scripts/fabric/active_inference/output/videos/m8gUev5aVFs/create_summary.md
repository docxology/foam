2. The predictiveness of happiness relates to optimal cognitive functioning.
3. Sub-optimal beliefs contribute to various psychopathologies, like depression and addiction.
4. Cognitive rigidity hinders belief updating, exacerbating mental health issues.
5. Well-being may involve optimal updating of generative models in response to environments.
6. Emotional states signal how well predictions align with reality, impacting well-being.
7. Social media can create filter bubbles, isolating beliefs and impairing mental health.
8. Good predictors adapt to uncertainty, promoting flexible thinking and healthy behaviors.
9. Higher hedonia involves diverse, enriching experiences, while lower hedonia leads to isolation.
10. Philosophical perspectives inform the application of active inference in health and ethics.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding active inference enhances insights into both mental health and happiness.
2. Optimal well-being requires flexibility in belief updating and sensory engagement.
3. Psychological resilience is fostered by maintaining diverse experiences and relationships.
4. Awareness of cognitive rigidity can help mitigate mental health pathologies.
