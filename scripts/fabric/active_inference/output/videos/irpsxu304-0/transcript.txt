hello and welcome it's October 25th 2024 and we're in active math art stream number 10 shanana to you hi everyone thank you for joining us today it's my great pleasure to introduce my dear colleague Sonia who's going to be talking about all things mirrored a speculation into the effects of Reflections duplication and symmetry through active inference welcome Sonia hello and thank you uh infinitely for having me here it's a it's a real pleasure um yeah it's uh really funny how this was supposed to be a Halloween stream originally on November 1st which was kind of like the you know the mirrored consequent of Halloween in a way but now it's uh in the true Spirit as I was joking with Shana of saturnalia where everything is not the way it is or is supposed to be we are in a completely different situation which is great um as we will see uh one thing that I think is interesting if you want to you can go into your Zoom settings and change the reflection um option that mirrors your image just for an extra kind of alienating productive alienation experience and later maybe we can point the cameras at themselves if possible depending on your your camera setup at the end of the stream that would be fun to kind of end in a nice Loop um so just for uh yeah Clarity this is really this is not a paper this is really just a very playful speculation and pardon the P there will be many um I started think off with this thinking about reflection and then I moved more towards symmetry um because of various reasons as we will see and B basically I'm interested in the kind of um yeah dialectical solicitation of difference so difference considered as Infinity as always something else being possible when performing and producing a self model or a model in general um if if we're thinking uh kind of of hegan dialectics with where this operation of the infinitely dialectical self- relation like the self or the center being the other eating the other forgetting the other creating the other uh and for example something like the identity operator capturing this this structure uh like always possibly doing nothing is in a way doing the infinite then what I'm interested in is is kind of framing symmetry as irreversible difference and not as reflected duplication or even more oxymoronically as uh invariance under transformation because as we will see uh symmetry can be understood as representing differential transformation and not induct Ive sameness but also inductive sameness we will go through all this um and in some places here I really stick my neck out because uh there are a lot of kind of Unfinished Business loose ends and things that I don't know enough about that I will be saying things about but that's kind of where you risk and you learn and you move on um and like the L say like we can only talk about things that we don't know in a way you know that's where the the problems the pro where you encounter a problem right it's that's where you do Solutions um let's see so to inspire a kind of U blanket switching mode of thought the order or method of things here will be that I will go through a lot of slides running through variations on symmetry across domains and a lot of these slides are very densely packed so I'm not going to go into detail uh with everything that is on the slides but they're there for future reference in case we want to discuss them later or in case you know if the stream is watched people can pause and look at things and look them up Etc so um all of the slides will have at least something like an observation or an example which I will refer to as the micro bit that we zoom into and then I kind of generalize and claim that that we draw from this which I refer to the micro or the abstract level and then references to literature and other works that ground this um maybe what emerges if we're lucky is the mesos scale that Shana often elicits as we do this um and in some slides there are proposals for definitions of of symmetry based on the examples and observations one of the things that I'm interested in thinking about as a kind of background proposal but it's definitely not something that I that I uh am going to go into a lot of depth is that we can think about phenomenal symmetry as a kind of Smoking Gun of deeper seated symmetries in how we kind of structure understand uh frame and measure reality and this is the kind of chicken or egg invention and Discovery question uh you know are we coupling two structures out there or are we creating them and what is the what what what is that question even um symmetry is a very paradoxical concept it's absolutely everywhere but we never truly have it um and again as I said like symmetry as invariance under transformation or as uh the identity operator as induction as reversibility as the basic quality that gives any being its being uh we'll think about like a lot of different ways in which we can frame this and uh yeah maybe consider it as a kind of anti basic principle if possible if that makes any sense we'll see how we get there so um we will constantly return to the theme of things that return to themselves um something very very interesting and a very grounding thinker for me is Boris and sure a lot of people will be familiar with his work he dealt with so many different topics um but primarily with with the infinite and what thought does with that um and in this short story which is in the in thef collection of fictions um he I I just want to quote this one can you see my my cursor yeah right or no it's perfect cool so I just want to I want to slite this one little bit it's in Spanish so quickly translated it's like maybe in my face the magic was written maybe I it was I it was myself that was the the the end of my search in a way uh I really recommend you to go look into the short story I'm not going to um spoil it for you but it's really fantastic um so there are plenty of of proposals um about what symmetry does this is a very general state if there was if there ever was any um so inspired by a recent comment by Chris fields in at the toos Institute where he mentions Shana's work together with him which is really really nice uh he says he mentions a possible her istic of um you know if you if you have a theory or a principle or a concept try to apply it to yourself and um try to see what happens and this is what I'm trying to do with symmetry here and especially within the social realm and when with within the context of sameness and what we understand each other to be uh this is something that I find really really fascinating and quite paradoxical in many different ways um again these are examples and things we can return to I'm not going to go into them I just want to leave them there to to inspire you but not necessarily to kind of explain them or or do ex aesis of things they're just points to touch upon and to think about perhaps later this is a quick break and in case there are immediate questions or needs for clarification that might have like if something was missed or if you lost the thread at some point let me know no we're going good okay and then we continue so symmetry is of course like the most cliche thing ever in maths in physics in Aesthetics but again so this her istic of whenever something appears obvious that I I didn't read it out but it was on the first slide or the second slide whenever something appears obvious or clear or simple that's exactly where you should dig I would say and we talk about symmetry all the time as if the concept itself is clear but I don't think it is um so as a possible kind of common denominator of B basic patternicity it nags at this chicken R question at this difference and repetition Paradox it constantly begs the question do we produce or do we perceive it it's everywhere and nowhere in a way you know the the universe is radically asymmetrical but we keep producing performing symmetry into it or vice versa in the very concept of speculation right um a a speculum is a reflector a Looking Glass a mirror but also a copy an imitation uh from from the uh Indo European route of of spec to observe um and here I just want to read a quote uh by Pur which is really interesting this is more on the idea of symmetry as duplication the first and simplest kind of Truth is the resemblance of a copy it may be roughly stated to consist in a sameness of predicates a false copy is one which claims to resemble an object which it does not resemble but this never fully occurs for two reasons in the first place the falsehood does not lie in the copy itself but in the claim which it is made which is made for it in the superscription for instance in the second place as there must be some resemblance between the copy and its object this falsehood cannot be entire hence there is no absolute truth or falsehood of copies copies are therefore not bearers of truth values indices like a person's name are conventional and do not have genuine generality what is genuine generality um so and on the background here what you see is an image that I made some years ago with an electron micros scope of a mirror uh so a mirror without light and then what happens when you see a mirror without light or when you see a mirror with light because you know electrons touch it and then you get photons in return when you're looking at this image um but yeah so I will continue to use the concept I'm going to twist it and turn it all the time in ways that seem unfamiliar and perhaps a lot of disagreement can emerge and this is part of the that's that's my asymmetrical interest here definitely Concepts in my book are only useful if they create friction and they change so we will do a kind of imental phenomen uh concept from Gabriel katran philosopher and physicist um and what I want to say about this and why so I'm not going to read out the quote but you feel free to browse a little bit through it why I'm interested in this um imental phenomics and the art uh examples that I will be using is that art gets in a way this is not what krine is saying the the the the the come on the two dots now I forget what called notation the two dots are not reflecting what it is this is just what I what I want to say with it art gets at the specificity at face value individuation every single time right we have sort of uniqueness of objects at least in the context of a lot of Western Art making that we know ourselves to be within and philosophy on the other hand wants generality so how things hang together in the most General sense or the most abstract sense is what seller wants from philosophy in a way what I want to say in this math Arts stream is that mathematics is the Middle Road the mes Road sh um it's where we can have both where we can have creative exploration and dialogue enabling formalization this is super super super important what do we do when we have too many degrees of freedom the Middle Road right so um can symmetry be interpreted as some kind of basic unit of of perception and thus meaning to think about this right like can can it be the sort of meso AIS uh in ways the Greeks certainly thought so uh and a lot of artistic Expressions you know worldwide definitely uh think so mysticism of of All Sorts uh continue to insist on this um the pop pop mask guy Marcus doaty says like you know symmetry is super useful if you're in the jungle and you able to recognize symmetry it's either something that's going to eat you or you can eat it and I'm like well yeah sure but again in my interest in sort of looking at the social realm and other more um kind of perhaps complex and interesting ways of relating to other models and modeling things out there is that there's also symmetry in the petting of an animal in a conversation and in all sorts of other like it's not necessarily um as easy as survival of the fittest as it's often framed so in biological evolution with duplication via reproduction being the most fundamental thing that anything must do to proceed to occupi more space time beyond the kind of dissipating shackles um that constrain it the usual tail is that symmetry does more with less right that for one for the price of two uh and the most obvious signature of this are the patterned bodies of most creatures but then we can go against this um marrying or symmetrical proposal between Simplicity and Symmetry and again we will continue to challenge this dictum of invariance under transformation and we can endorse maybe this idea of um which is here uh on the screen as presented by Longo and mon that variability is at the core obviously transformation is at the core obviously sort of things are not pre- statable every time so this doesn't imply a total relativity as we will see um but attending to these kind of effects of symmetry and arriving at ideas of shared attention can be generative in very interesting asymmetrical ways so uh here we can think about social symmetry as the recognition of shared attention but this is important to mention the recognition of shared attention not necessarily a kind of sameness in shared attention um you know synchronicities and harmonizations of All Sorts between beings are what what can be understood as a kind of yeah self attention symmetry here um this is kind of a theology we can think in many ways because well in any social encounter now I'm going read what's on the top uh right in any social encounter you know both agents in the case that we have two we it can be groups or it can be different things uh are not only uncertain about themselves because they have partial access to to their own self models but at the same time they're uncertain about each other this is lum's double contingency the mutual uncertainty in social interactions uh and this gets some you know interesting possible observations because of this kind of reductive Simplicity about what whatever that is shared sorry because of its reductive Simplicity or idea of whatever is shared is simpler than I missed the word there something happened on that slide uh the alignment of mental States is only an uncertainty minimizing strategy about the other but importantly about what is considered shared at that moment right so however precisely because of the total contingency of the other it's a permanent dance where we don't know we don't really know what is going on on the other end and this as will be mentioned throughout is what maintains the status of the other as infinite and as generative and politically we are talking about a radical anti- conservatism here uh let me see if I wanted to say anything else about this no so the implications of this are quite interesting so what what are kind of the Mortal the implications of our mortal computations here what does this mean for the perception performance of future patterns if we're sensitive to Flat Minima making others infinite as the operation where there can always be an excess is possibly I would say the only way forward so thinking about the roads to symmetry in biomimetics or for example the the the Tendencies to anthropomorph to make symmetrical projects uh such as so-called artificial intelligence we should be wary what we wish for um what suggest is that we could look at the future of intelligence not as a Difference Engine but as a kind of self-repairing we're capable of moral goal orientations and the trouble here is that we do not know uh what we want nor what we are in search of especially when we kind of have confused concepts of sameness we simply continue to run into problems and solutions and run into problems and solutions and considering this uh why submit to what is given right um this is really interesting proposal from the Xeno feminist Manifesto if nature is unfair if we always kind of return to kind of patterns in nature and and sort of things we observe out there as grounding principles for how we should behave and like a lot of people do this I'm not saying we should but um if nature is unfair then we change nature right and this is crucial I think to think about right now if we see the the acceleration of something like language models having you know been fueled and become super proficient by scraping text we know for sure that we will be talking we will be able to create Talking Heads by scraping the content of YouTube including this talk and this will lead to scenarios where not only can we create crazy amazing content and uh but also scenarios where we can possibly modulate existing content content and let's say that you don't like my voice and ask the interface to change it to something more de liking with a different perhaps and uh that seems innocuous enough um but when you realize that the the personal and kind of self-based curation of the world takes us further and further away from creative Collective imagination U that's kind of it's interesting so in order to think kind of planetary skill survival of all beings we need to think ourselves as one type of thing more and more but how do we do that with confused concepts of sameness who imitates who remains the question but it's a very important question and here's um two examples that are interesting so Genesis v p origin lady J who started getting plastic surgery to look like each other so who's who's copying who right and what what are the dialectics there it's super interesting um and then uh U here a diagram from the noise research Union that I'm part of where we started uh trying to think about the emergence of synthetic systems and the kind of communication between organic and synthetic systems and the sort of possible behavioral contamination that occurs right like you have the human behavior like the machine the machine behaving like the human Etc ET and going looping upwards into a sort of intensified Vortex up there where there is no ending sight at least in this diagram so uh another pause in case there is breather room needed or any questions immediately coming up siia can you go back to the slide and explain the fish the fish uh I love it this keeps coming back to me I love it and there will be fish later in the presentation so the fish is like a theme um so this is from from zangi and it's a kind of parable you know it's one of these open-ended Affairs where we are left to infinitely wonder what is going on so there is an observation that that fish are kind of one SE looks at fish and and sees kind of movement and and and some kind of joy is apparent to Swang in the fish and then who says to him because Swang Z says the fish look happy and he says zy response you are not a fish how do you know that the fish are happy and then Swan responds and I love it's amazing you are not I how do you know that I do not know that the fish are happy and it's super interesting oh there is a a hand up from from Dean go for well I have a bunch of questions um first of all I was curious what you thought I'm always going to ask questions in the context of of Education because that's kind of myr um so I was wondering what you thought about per the the quote that you gave from uh purse and I wonder what you could say about the idea of originality based uh because he said something I think he said something pretty important but indirectly about originality I was wondering about your opinion on that and then I have two other questions I think yeah I have a slide on on um or it's a comment that I have as a note for mentioning uh later on which is precisely about this kind of creativity so is the creativity uh that we constantly sort of conjure as a as an ineffable thing that for example I don't know artificial systems cannnot have but the human does have like is that to be found in the kind of um exploitation of a chance encounter or is it something kind of that can be considered as originating from from from a plan whether conscious or unconscious that sort of ended up coming out of an individual or a group or a situation uh that's a very strange thing to con consider right because well if we if we try to think about I don't know your history being the reason why you are here and how you are etc etc then we need to go with chance encounters but at the same time we have these kind of grand narratives of the person developing you know the lone genius and the thing that kind of has the Eureka moment and all these types of Affairs that I think I hope we're we're modulating into other things currently so that we can get out of some entrenched narratives about who deserves to do uh you know art or who deserves to do philosophy who is the mathematician who is the where we're coming to terms especially I guess in the context of this stream we're coming to terms with like a lot of the overlaps between all of these things and a lot of the contingencies there and how we can appreciate the yeah the emergence of very interesting narratives that are collective and that Branch out in all sorts of directions uh rather than sort of like really simply minimizing the uncertainty of just someone being a genius for example and being creative and being original and um and that's the reason why something is interesting to a large group of people um yeah I don't know if that answers the question but it's kind of fantastic so and the next slide uh I'd never seen anything by Gabriel katren before this morning um but I wish I had because in terms of my sense of how lots of things get better understood with a minimum of two uh perspective he uses the phrase the hybrid neologism which you copied out and and I always again back to the idea of Ed what education is I wonder what he would then how he would look at subject matter expertise and what he would put put up against that like I put up prediction matter expertise as a as a hybrid hybridization I was wondering what what what what about this TransAm WTIC idea do you think applies to how we share information in an educational setting as as as a potential not just theoretical because I know it can be applied practically but as a as a way of understanding hybridization and learning yeah well it's it's a huge question but I think like a very simple example as a starting point could be like the questioning of of of standards in education so like of course on the one hand if you have large groups of people that's how we've organized education in the context of of modern classrooms generally you know I'm speaking very generally there are many different educational pedagogical settings but let's say the classroom setting with one teacher and a bunch of students uh you need standards for everyone to kind of align themselves to something right but at the same time you need the understanding of if people are coming from different perspectives Traditions situations etc those standards necessarily need to be permanently regulated and also uh yeah just open to to questioning every single time and also what one person um excels at is not what the other excels at obviously so what is it exactly that we are testing when there is a test situ situation after the class has finished um it's uh it's it's something to consider uh it could be that we start developing new and I I know a little bit about this uh not very very much I'm also uh teaching so I I kind of encounter this experience weekly um but um I what I say I know a little bit about this in in the research sense of like what people have been looking into when they talk about this so uh you know someone who grew up in a very philosophical context will do differently in a test on philosophy than the person who didn't but then we can find a way in which in the classroom different outcomes are expected of of students rather than just a standard test where they all check uh how much they've aligned with the supposed like standard knowledge that they should have because we're interested in seeing what people do with knowledge not in kind of a static uh kind of snapshot of what this knowledge currently is and and yeah and how much you've consumed in order to be able to pass a test it's it's it's strange but we're changing these paradigms I think and uh that's what that's what is super interesting about thinking you know in about this symmetry a symmetry and about um what we understand the sameness about each other standards and how we can be creative and formal at the same time uh there will be more slides on that later and that's that's fantastic and and just one last thing U not not the um you are not a fish how do you know who I am but on that same slide there's something that really stood out to me which again I'm I'm big big Thomas cellan uh defining joint attention as triotic situations I I wondered in the in the complexity of a reflective frame versus as an an expansion frame how you might take that idea of triatic situation in which two or more individuals possess reliable evidence and how that opens literally opens up possibility yeah yeah I I've been thinking about so for me okay purs is in the background again with with thirdness right where you where you have this this permanent uh transformation of of what it is that you're looking at thinking about doing with something once you have something you necessarily have the other thing and you necessarily have the other thing and they kind of constantly relate to each other um but in the sense of yeah this has this has this has traveled with me forever as a as a thought experiment or as a as a speculation trying to understand like where does joint attention come from at at the very originary point in in in a kind of evolutionary trajectory so when did two things suddenly have a sense of shared attention right like when did when at which point not that we can treat it back to one point it's probably like a bunch of different things and a bunch of different variants etc etc etc but when yeah at which point does this kind of abstraction which for me the sort of pointing indexical thing of saying like here is something and I understand you to also understand that I'm kind of uh that I understand that you exist there capable of looking at the or looking or sensing whatever the thing that I'm also In This Moment attending to that's fascinating that's for me like the first abstract move in a lot of ways and that's why it's it's a confused Identity or it's a confused difference because it's all those things at the same time there is that thirdness right permanently U being that that triadic um formulation of attention which is super super interesting but I can't say more than that I just think it's fascinating and it's a crazy speculation but I don't know if it could be Su up is what can I let go in order to get to a new KN a new I guess yeah how would you can you expand on that Aid no I mean it's it's it's it's that that's the speculation per se it's what it's what what do I have to stop believing or what can I what can I stop attending to in order to allow the the the new idea to to to fill that problem space totally totally yeah and that's a scaling issue a spal temporal scaling like how much do you think a concept is tracking for example like how much time is a concept tracking versus another concept uh and how are they different between people these kinds of things are are really important to to think about and to and now that we have modeling capacities for for some of these things it's even more so uh like the pressing question when we use concepts of like the social people uh attention what how what what do we think those concepts are tracking in terms of their their length like their historis and their possible Futurity that's where the questions are I will move on because I look at the time and I we can we can discuss a bit more later so we looked at this we had a pause um yeah I mean this is continuing from what we were just saying right so uh the idea of inductive symmetry like you know something was just now and so it continues to be as the kind of recognition or enfor enforcement of sameness and this is where um we get to the what I was talking about you you need to have the sort of trust in knowledge but also trust in its possible permanent change uh in the con context would be here bashard with's rationalism he says a happily incomplete reason can no longer fall asleep in a tradition it can no longer rely on memory to recite this toies right like we really need um something else and um yeah in terms of U in terms of the kind of psychophysics of it is the kind of the blanket hinge between Sim stimuli and action we can we can pull a vast array of of inductive symmetric phenomena as kind of experiential adaptation as habituation as priming as adjusting receptive sensitivity to prolonged stimulation any kind of pavlovian affair of course uh becoming Adept uh all manner of sensorial Illusions are Testament to this right so we can look at uh this sensorial illusion for a few seconds if you're interested just stare at the middle without moving your eyes and see what happens if all go according to plan the edges of the grid should heal themselves um but um yeah this is uh this kind of enforcement or or recognition of s sameness is what I could pull then in this sort of idea of inductive Symmetry and uh I'm going to yeah I'm going to move on because otherwise we don't have time but all of these things are really interesting to look into the GL the grou bleen Paradox and the projectability of uh of of predicates of abstractions is super interesting and Nelson Goodman's work about this so like yeah how much for how long and how does a concept track time um the idea of kind of spatial temporal metaphors grounding the experience from which mathematics as an abstraction emerges is is also very famous from from Lake of and nunus um so kind of thinking of abstractions into a projectible futility and motion within that realm as a kind of Min something some minimally encrypted symmetry because to move we need to we need to kind of minimally know that where we were at just now right um this is a kind of what we could think of as a basic symmetric condition but again and here I frame invariance on the transformation as a as a contradiction in the non- derogative sense and I also treat Illusions in this non- derogative sense like Illusions or contradictions are the most interesting breaking points at which things actually reveal their inner logic a little bit more when you see an illusion you actually see how your perception works right it's not like you're being Illusions are always presented as like the thing that doesn't work but it's exactly the opposite that's exactly what's working and the same with contradictions that's when you see things um hanging in their sort of mechanics which is really really interesting um yeah going to move on to the next one so Shephard who doesn't get enough credit I think in the in the context of uh of of of predictive uh processing and active inference because he he he like formulated a lot of these things um really well quite early on and he always insisted that the sort of elusive boundary between the mental and the real has a very particular symmetry so whatever happens in our inner imagin Pro projections takes the time the kind of projected labor it would take um to to actually undertake that imagined action when we do mental acrobatics like move on a map from A to B and these kinds of things uh and this is an interesting place to speculate about the phenomenal distinction between space and time right the sort of proposed idea that thought takes time but very little space somehow the separation between the two might have been one of the first cognitive strategies I imagine that you know beings with future projection uh had um let me see if I want to go through all this quite a lot about Shepherd so yeah so he says though all such principles are somehow like basic principles about perception are somehow instantiated in the brain their ultimate nonarbitrary source must be sold in the regularities of the world including those reflecting abstract mathematical principles but then this is the question right regular regularities where and then we go back to something like this and we can think about regularities in quite interesting ways um so if we if we want to move against kind of reductive picture like interpretations um where the mirror is something useful as it is delusive uh we have to think you know if action and perception can't be pulled apart and our generative model and generative models are are controlled systems as uh cited there by Ram all um then you know for starters we have to think about learning in different ways right uh and while what we think of the the rogatory ways in which we treat very interesting generative abstract things such as metaphorce um which have an underlying analogical operation which is a symmetric type of situation uh which yeah in the future of kind of trying to understand language more and more mathematically and then just kind of tracking how people speak and seeing how it is that those structures that they're trying to express have a formal background that can be M mapped out in so many interesting and creative ways this is like these are the fundamental questions I think but anyway so um again the self returning to the self and uh a quote from shelling here which is super interesting and reflects back on the the bores quote I opened with Nature's highest goal to become holy and object to herself is achieved only through the last and highest order of reflection which is no other than man okay scratch that man there or more generally it is what we call reason super interesting and so many people keep saying this in so many different ways um I like to think about this as kind of these self- relations are sort of of course homeostasis ostasis hesis self-design and a kind of orders or levels you could think about it the thermostat returns to a set point the identity operator returns to a self point and it of Alo or hom stat returns to a telepoint um in the sense that it's kind of really projecting itself forward in ways that it cannot account for on the basis of what has been induced right if we think about another formulation of the free energy principle is like anything that inducts induces or anything that induces inducts sort of the creation of a of a of a light cone um in in Le terminology this is something that you know it cannot Poss as he says you know you can imagine so many more things than you can actually accomplish for example within a lifetime and then thinking about how all the different hierarchies that could possibly bring some of those things about um coupled to each other is uh yeah that's where the sort of Tel points become interesting projections to think about um maybe I will skip this one in the interest of time but these are problems yeah like I said earlier of organization and of the kind of moving goal post of and of of varying skills I missed the the slash there apologies you know Mickey Mouse brooms or paper clips in the in the scenarios that we currently talk about um another pause but we don't need it um yeah I skipped all of that so and again so Schmid Hoover say that all all science is kind of data compression right and he follows in line with a huge diversity of thinkers that we can pull under this kind of concept of simplification um and ultimately sure I think like it just depends on what we Define as data what we Define as a whole what we Define as comp compression what we Define as Simplicity this is where it gets very interesting to uh explore the the the frictions between and of Concepts um I tend to prefer the concept of Simplicity instead of accur accy for example in the cont context of complexity and accuracy in in exploring exploiting uh strategies because Simplicity is something that we can for me conceptually more easily frame as a made thing as a decision that is biased you know so many different ways uh we simplify from something that we know we know it's reductive accuracy implies that we actually catch reality and that for me is more problematic um that we get a of ontological pattern which we still don't know whether it is there or not right if anything the universe kind of really really complexifies in its ramifications all the time um and the results of science lead to more results and more results and more problems so it's difficult to then say like science is about compression because what we're actually doing is exploding a whole bunch of Realms into Noble more interesting things all the time so we can think about compression the kind of the sum Which is less than the parts um the cartisian simulation of the self jokingly kind of coo ero sum as in the sum not the sum but ethologically still traced back to the same thing um and if all communication is compression right uh then this implies that uh well in the encoding sending Channel Etc there is always a kind of selection which is why simplification for me is more interesting than than the concept of accuracy for example um so you know it really depends on on what we Define as reduction again we inevitably reduce all the time synthesis is reduction reduction is synthesis and to demand an accurate model of the universe is maybe asking the wrong question um questions are kind of postulates of possibility right uh if we cut them short we cut possibility short and um this is what leads me to the this was used recently for a for a conference that we did um the answer there's actually like a melted sugar cube I took this picture many years ago and it just looks like they're onto nothing or they are kind of in veneration of something inexistence inexistent holy or absent these are all the musings we've been going through I love I love I know Daniel that you're an ant person um I really have been also for many many years so this is a really nice coincidence as well this was the opening line of the of the conference abstracts and presentation anyway so what is interesting here um besides what I've already mentioned in terms of education and these things the idea of making the other infinite which would mean making the other kind of asymmetrical is what I find that the sort of most easy goto her istic for thinking about how we should then kind of continue to to to modulate this Con concept of of symmetry or sameness between social beings so if the other if you have a model of the other then you essentially kind of you're doing a reduction for your purposes of of how they're going to behave and what you can expect etc etc if there is room for excess and if there is room for uh so in infinity and the other if there is always something that you're just assuming you're never going to get and it's absolutely you know fantastic to continue to learn about this other being group history whatever that keeps things interesting that keeps things open uh it's very cly said in the way I'm for formulating it now but this is for me kind of heuristic solution to a lot of the social problems that we that we continue to uh to to en counter like there's always a sort of preference for the reduction of the other towards something uh understandable uh in the context of the where I am for example uh there is this kind of Dutch Dutch concept of tolerance for the other which I find horrific it can be interpreted as something nice and kind of the other is infinite you tolerate them despite whatever uh they are but it's it's pretty awful I think also it's sort of like you know the Dutch really Pat themselves on the on the back for being tolerant to other cultures and in practice they are quite uh harsh to put it to put it mildly um uh so now we're nearing to the to the final bit and just I want to leave you with this kind of symmetry between livits and um and the free energy principle um super interesting like uh livets of course had this image of the monad right like this thing that reflects the entire universe the basic the basic component of everything that we know to be like the substance of the universe is is like infin an infinitude of monets but these are closed they don't have windows so they are bounded by a kind of conditional Independence and uh this is something that we can really like there's there's just a beautiful parallel there there to be made I wish I could read all of this it's on the screen but I leave it there for for later uh I highlighted the things in color um uh that are that are interesting comparisons or Parallels between the two things um yeah and and as a final bit just a kind of visual metaphor on on what we can variant like different ways of reductionism compression synthesis that we can think of um so we have for example here the idea of the all these patterns being something that you induce on then you have an observation and then you have the simplification of that into a kind of habit right or you can have data in hypothesis a measurement and the confirmation is the reduction or a concept like trust can be like leaving things as they are right and you just continue with the things that you knew hyper and then you can have the hype and the relief and then the fiction that makes itself real complexity noise reduction bias sampling and then compression Etc different types of things that do similar operations and I guess yeah I guess I'm gonna leave it there because I because I have a few more slides sh I really wanted wanted Nobody Knows My Name by Baldwin it's fine I'm not going to mention but I'm going to leave it there um maybe yeah close with this so again so art gets a at specificity at individuation um but then how things hang together in the most AB abstract sense is kind of combined with this in the best possible scenario uh through through creative mathematics so that's I think a nice uh closing closing line for the math Arts stream thanks a lot awesome thank you shanana and then Dean go for it and if anyone live chat has questions they can write it uh yes s can you go to the slide before this um yeah can you say a little bit about this slide and also the slide before it because I know um you're in a time crunch but they're so beautiful yeah so maybe let's think about a combination of both so maybe um so this is again I'm thinking uh Gabrielle here because he uh he referred me to doer who has this really nice dictum based on the dictum of like no Masters no no Gods right and he has like no meter which then in in French would sound the same as Master met so no meter no God and here I have like no simet no God which is interesting so in the context of of Baldwin right like there's another quote from him uh here uh two actually which I can then go into in in with regards to the to nobody knows my name so he says the root function of language is to control the universe by describing it right and then I'm kind of pairing that up with active inference and I'm like yeah language structures generate longer light comes um and then he says elsewhere uh but in the same text the idea of white supremacy rests simply on the fact that white men are the creators of civilization the present civilization which is the only one that matters all pre previous civilizations are simply contributions to our own and are therefore civilizations Guardians and Defenders thus it was impossible for Americans to accept the black man as one of themselves for to do so was to jeopardize their status as white men but not but not so to accept them um was to deny his human reality his human weight and complexity and the strain of denying the overwhelmingly undeniable forced Americans into rationalization so fantastic that they approached the pathological so how are we bending the rules um with Concepts or and which rules so what does it mean to bend the rules what what are we doing with each other when we consider each other uh fellow human beings or um you know moving towards a a scenario which we it doesn't matter whether we share it or not in our imaginations but the fact that it will have to be shared right uh regardless it's very very very complicated to try to think about the planning of that and the mapping of that and the speeds of that you know how fast different uh types of future tracking Affairs are moving um where we're we're starting to change know from the Dynamics of the sort of the control of uh of of matter and the organization of bodies Etc more towards the the the control of uh attention and of other more what we've in the past perhaps considered more abstract things such as information uh rather than matter for example computation rather than matter and these are really really strange questions when you think about the politics of at least the last century right and what has happened with people trying to organize um or disorganize each other different way and then can you pull that back to the nobody knows my name if you go to that one yeah yeah that's a mask it's a kind of we used it for the for a workshop recently um it's a plastic mask and um yeah the mask is is one of the kind know Paramount crazy symmetrical objects right and attention objects you're hiding but you're presenting something else you're communicating but you're not um there's of course this idea of of of black skin white masks here embedded too and and the idea of double conscious business as well I like to layer things with a lot of meanings and then we can kind not talk about them or talk about them but um love it thanks I know Dean had something else yeah I just curious I I kind of combine the stuff that's on uh slides 17 and 21 um oh let me see I don't have them numbered here it's essentially the ant slide and the um this one the one with um on shellin so so so my question is um in Act of inference we talk about self-organizing self-organizing agents we also in this presentation looked at about looked at some identity organizing especially in these two slides I wonder when you sum those two processes what that looks like um especially through the lens of reflection and whether reflection helps us derive a satisfactory sum some as a compression and then some as as an expansion because I mean you're right it can be very very negative if you only look at the identity as self sorry if you only look at it as an agency organizing as self or as an agency organizing as an identity but if you put them together are there more constructive aspects of this or are they all compression outcomes yeah I think it just depends on what you're trying to do right and I think lately we are paying more attention to that like instead of we we think we've had structures that create uh coherence for social holes that are now yeah being questioned because they' become outdated in the sense of hey you know like I know um organizing um uh social coherence under like a one ruler king type of situation well you know in in kind of different types of democratic Affairs you have conduciveness to to more interesting stuff happening and other possibilities so then we move from one to the other and now we're kind of questioning or at least from my tiny perspective it's it's what I see as a pattern in in different realms for example in generative AI but also in education paradigms and different ways of social organization we're more and more interested in like hey what is it what is it that we're individually if we can frame the individual as a kind of self-contained Unity which is a questionable Affair but still because it's embedded in so many different levels of blankets um uh it's it's it's the creativity is in the in the possibilities for exploration in the uniqueness of of structures that continue to emerge rather than and sort of flattening of all the structures for you know um box Factory type of scenarios we need boxes but we need them four housing more interesting objects maybe you know Hector want to add anything can you go to the slide with the bow tie convergence and Divergence yes well remarkable presentation thank you for the very rich slides with many footh holes many eyeh holds and it made me think about another representation that comes up a lot with Mike Len's Diamond representation and so seeing there's a thickness of the current moment with a more summed origin and destination yeah yeah yeah and then so that's the thick diamond and then this is like gabo tiai and then how to how to flip back and forth and see both at once you gave many also accounts of too totally yeah okay I'll read can read a question from the chat yeah okay all right um stepen writes hello I think I speak for the Forum here in asking the question on all of our minds how can we make use of this to decrypt the Le Liber premise the Libra premise being the unsolved 55 pages of runes released in 2014 by the enigmatic cicada 33 301 without a page solve since I'm going to I'm going to ask that question back to [Music] Stephen okay next question from Bren hi Sonia can you speak to the materiality of difference or information What relation do you think these two concepts have to a material basis how do they relate to the world in terms of reduction thank you for the talk thank you um yeah that's I think what we are we are um and I say we as like a human project not that I'm um doing anything in this realm myself uh in in experimental terms though some bits and pieces might be coming up soon but uh yeah the limits the limits of um how we're encoding things materially right are are very obvious places where we look into this uh what Ma and you and I talked about recently Land hours principle at the conference that I was just mentioning with ants um so yeah um we we because of the ways that we try to access how information can be interestingly encoded into substrates um we come we we brush up against the limits of matter as we know it but then also we're discovering very interesting ways in which we can modulate matter differently and think about different types of computation um different models of computation so yeah the for me the ultimate question is always the formalization of difference um and and that is an experimental question uh currently luckily because it wasn't for many many years and people were just like difference difference what now we can actually look at difference in very different guises and that's um that's that's interesting where does your work continue on on towards for Sonia and for [Music] everyone for me I'm finishing a PhD now so I'm putting all of this into in in a less chaotic order than you've just seen and uh this is not the PHD this is just like a a part of something I've been thinking about um yeah but hopefully presenting with Shana next week which will be amazing please Shana if you want to say anything about your your work there it's no I think you should give a shout out about what we're going to present about so we're at this conference called the paradoxes of Madness and it will be streamed also so if you want to join please do it will be in hent which is not far from here uh in Belgium and um Shana will be streaming in I will be live and um I will talk about the paradoxes of uh the modulation of cognition with uh cortical ster and what has not yet been investigated there and Sh will talk about ptic hyper Fantasia which uh relates and in many ways explodes this I think in thinking about temporality and mesoscales and access to structure right yeah access to structure and structure without expiration dates how long do concepts last and why yeah so yeah Hector or Dean do you have any last comments oh well I'm sorry Sonia I mean thanks for your talk I had some problem with my connection so um but I mean I think that's an amazing topic and you refer to sharing of attention but before I'm also interested in this primary inter subjectivity uh where when babies at three month they are able to detect that there is a symmetry in the behavior of of mothers and well carers in general who is close to them and I think that's kind of the open door to to know in other minds but anyway I mean that's just something that happened before know there is an exchange of um like knowing that the other is sub experience or is to for that but definitely there is a symmetry that is the beginning of knowing Minds I would say yeah yeah yeah yeah totally but the crazy thing is how that becomes radically asymmetrical immediately right Al for example in in the work of thaso like not only in the idea that you just Lo yourself from like your your given ground your parents especially as a teenager and Beyond you want to be different you want to be something else but uh with with uh Thomas work on on looking at how um for example infant get irritated when this when the shared attention stops and these kinds of things right when when when something is not to their liking and what should be kind of symmetrical or what should move in a total smooth gradient all the time that's yeah it's fascinating it's impossible we're just permanently at odds with our parents yes yes also he places this um moral accountability which is symmetrical again so the sense of moral obligation it's like you and I make each other accountable for what we do so we have this symmetrical expectations and again this is symmetry when you expect I mean like the the Golden Rule you expect to be treated like you treat others right and yeah yeah but that depends yeah so our Norm also are symmetrical I would say or are based on symmetry yeah totally but then I would send I would question or again bring that quote from like if if there is some kind of order question it or if there is some sort of that's why the this this is really really funny this syncretic symmetry here um or the sort of if nature is unfair change nature or because it's how what model do you have in order to create the golden rule of how you want to be treated you know um this is something we again like symmetry we just don't question the the symmetric concept or the symmetric principle we're like oh it's it's a thing that's what it is same Ness enir on the transformation whatever but the same thing goes for the golden rule in the kind of colloquial way in the Canan way there is like a massive amount of literature and questioning this of course but in the colloquial way we can say like U what kind of self model do you have and do you think that others didn't have the same and want to be treated like you obviously we so that's true that's true thank you thank you so much no thank you math artists till next time thanks a lot you take care
