# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Sonia's presentation explores the intricate relationships between reflection, symmetry, identity, and how they shape perception and social interactions.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The session focuses on reflections, duplication, and symmetry through the lens of active inference.
2. Symmetry is framed as irreversible difference rather than mere duplication.
3. The exploration of symmetry spans various domains, utilizing densely packed slides for reference.
4. Phenomenal symmetry may reveal deeper symmetries in how we perceive reality.
5. The concept of symmetry is paradoxical, appearing everywhere yet never fully realized.
6. Social symmetry involves recognizing shared attention without enforcing sameness.
7. The interplay of identity and self-models raises questions about originality and creativity.
8. Symmetry can be seen as a basic unit of perception influencing social interactions.
9. The presentation argues for a shift from reductive views to embracing complexity and uniqueness.
10. The discussion highlights the need for critical examination of established norms and concepts of sameness.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Reflection and symmetry shape our understanding of self and others in social contexts.
2. Exploring asymmetry can lead to richer insights in art, philosophy, and mathematics.
3. Shared attention in social interactions is key to understanding relational dynamics.
4. Creativity emerges from the interplay between individual uniqueness and collective experiences.
5. Questioning established norms can foster deeper engagement with difference and identity.
