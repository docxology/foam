# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Shauna Dobson discusses the diamond holographic principle, emergent time, and connections between mathematics, cognition, and active inference.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The diamond holographic principle relates to gauge gravity duality and emergent time.
2. Pro emergence combines multiple emergent times into a unified framework.
3. Active inference examines the nature of time and local versus global perceptions.
4. Diamonds can represent complex mathematical objects and higher categorical structures.
5. Non-locality suggests that time and events can be interconnected across distances.
6. The relationship between simultaneity and non-locality is a significant area of exploration.
7. The concept of a pro object allows for more complex mathematical representations.
8. Infinitesimal thickening offers a way to understand boundaries in mathematical spaces.
9. Reciprocity laws connect disparate mathematical theories, enhancing understanding of time.
10. The complexity of biological systems illustrates the interplay between emergence and irreversibility.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Emergent time can be understood through the lens of mathematical structures like diamonds.
2. Non-locality plays a crucial role in understanding the interconnectedness of events and time.
3. The idea of pro emergence provides a framework for integrating multiple perspectives on time.
4. The boundaries of cognition and perception are more fluid than traditionally thought.
5. Exploring the relationship between mathematics and biology can yield insights into consciousness.
