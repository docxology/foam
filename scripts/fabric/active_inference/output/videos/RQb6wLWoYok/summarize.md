# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Shauna Dobson's talk explores the diamond holographic principle, emergent time, and complex mathematical frameworks in relation to active inference.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The diamond holographic principle reinterprets complex mathematical structures in physics and cognition.
2. Emergent time consists of multiple local and global timeframes interacting within a mathematical framework.
3. Pro emergence suggests that emergence is inherent to the structure of mathematical objects.
4. The concept of simultaneity is examined through mathematical and cognitive lenses.
5. Time and boundaries are described as pro-finite, challenging traditional notions of linear time.
6. The relationship between cognition and entanglement raises questions about object persistence.
7. Active inference frameworks can be expanded through multi-scale and pro-finite approaches.
8. The interplay of local and global time can inform our understanding of neurobiology.
9. Theories of time travel are explored through the lens of cognitive and mathematical frameworks.
10. Reciprocity laws link different branches of mathematics, providing a unified approach to complex systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the diamond holographic principle can enhance insights into both mathematics and cognitive science.
2. Emergent time frameworks can lead to new perspectives on human cognition and perception.
3. The relationship between time, boundaries, and cognition is complex and warrants further exploration.
4. Multi-scale approaches can deepen our understanding of active inference and its applications.
5. Collaborative discussions among diverse fields can yield innovative solutions to philosophical and scientific questions.
