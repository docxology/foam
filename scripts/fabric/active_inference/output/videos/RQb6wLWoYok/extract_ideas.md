# IDEAS

- Shauna Dobson discusses the diamond holographic principle and emergent time in mathematics.
- The talk is interactive, inviting questions and community engagement throughout the presentation.
- The diamond concept relates to the idea of pro emergence, where smaller self-contained objects combine into a larger whole.
- Continuous K theory is essential for classifying difficult mathematical objects using isomorphism classes.
- Emergent time is described as doubly emergent, with both local and global dimensions.
- The concept of non-locality is explored, questioning the differences between simultaneity and non-locality.
- The diamond holographic principle reinterprets gauge gravity duality in terms of continuous K theory and pro emergence.
- Active inference is linked to time streams and the mathematical understanding of simultaneity.
- The notion of a "v stack" allows for categorization of objects within time and space.
- The discussion includes the question of measuring emergent time and its implications for cognition.
- There is a focus on embodied cognition and how it relates to emergent time and non-locality.
- The relationship between strong and weak coupling in physics is discussed in the context of the diamond framework.
- The idea of topological localization is introduced, connecting it to reflective subcategories in mathematics.
- Pro objects in category theory are discussed as foundational elements for understanding emergence in mathematical structures.
- The talk reflects on how mathematics can provide insights into philosophical questions about time, cognition, and reality.
- The potential for time travel is speculated upon, linking it to the concept of multiplicity and hidden states in cognition.
