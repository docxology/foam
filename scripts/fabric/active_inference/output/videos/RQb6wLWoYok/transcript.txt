hello and welcome everyone to actin flab today is may 6 2021 and we're really excited to have shauna dobson back for mathstream 2.1 this is going to be a fun discussion diamond holographic principle and d square emergent time maybe you'll teach us how to pronounce it and what it is so thanks again for coming on this stream and really looking forward to it so please take it away thank you so much daniel i just want to say your community is so supportive and i'm so happy to be back for a second talk you are all working on some of the most you know profound ideas um here and so i'm really excited and thank you for having me yay all right so this talk i'm gonna go a little bit into the more like the diamond part because i got some feedback on what are these diamonds and what was she talking about and so i was really excited that d square is actually a d diamond for emergent time so um if i i'll try to do my best to lay all these out please ask um like daniel was saying questions every you know 10 slides or something like that i'm happy to answer it um i'm also trying to constellate and weave together this sort of kind of grand unified picture so um there's some drawings in here and i hope that it's fun okay so uh let's let's go um i'll be talking about the diamond holographic principle and d diamond emergent time yay okay so the goal i sort of talked about this last time but not too too in detail um today i'm gonna actually weave together this kind of new math with uh active inference and let's try to put it together and all work together so the goal is like to take the holographic principle which we're you know um um all aware of uh which was like begotten by um maldacena's uh you know a beautiful gauge gravity duality between anti-disinterface space and conformal field theory i have an idea to sort of reinterpret it in terms of continuous k theory and something i'm going to call pro emergence so a pro object is a specific object kind of in category theory that's being used everywhere and it's sort of this idea of sewing together a bunch of kind of smaller things that are self-contained to get a grand object and it's sort of built into the very structure i thought oh this is a great idea so i talked about k theory a little bit last time which is this beautiful construction by grothen deek to actually look at classifying very difficult objects using isomorphism classes of the spaces so it's like oh we can tell if two spaces are equivalent based on their equivalence relations and i thought that's a very very very nice higher way of looking at things and there's a new work uh by ephemoth talking about continuous k theory so again this idea of sort of sewing together maybe smaller k theories to build a bigger object so for this pro emergence right i am fascinated by time and i want us to kind of get into it right how does active inference see these uh these sort of time streams like are there little local times with little thicknesses around them what is this so in this this idea of mine is pro emergence you have a doubly emergent time that's emergent on two fronts so um you have a local singular condensed time which is sort of the time that we all experience this very like you know i'm presenting to uh your lovely community 906 a.m this is like shanna's now right but there's also like you know alpha centauri now and the unicorn constellation now right so there's all these different nouns and who's now is what so you have these like local singular time and then you're going to have actually have this global what i'm going to try to push for is a non-locality in the diamonds so um to rephrase the holographic principle and kind of upgrading ads which is anti-sitter space which is the bulk which has gravity in it i'm going to try to actually rebuild that from the six functor formalism so that's what you see in this figure with these um sort of six columns is the six operations uh from peter schultz the telecomology of diamonds it's so beautiful so imagine building space from a functor formalism which is a very very specific and then um if you're going to get the conformal field theory which has no gravity um i was thinking okay so the gravity list should could be in the pro-finite condition of the diamond so you see i have a bunch of diamonds kind of glued together and so maybe this gluing in the diamond condition can kind of you know replace the conformal field theory so in this um you can actually get a holography and it's really interesting to think what active inference thinks about uh holography like what's the actual um reflection what's the actual object so you can relate this to strong and weak coupling you know whichever theory is strong right has a strong coupling which is like you know the tension um um you know in the interaction terms and um so you can relate you know you know whichever one you know has maybe a a weaker coupling you normally use like a perturbation theory the stronger coupling you have to use the non-perturbation methods so it's very physics-oriented um and you know the beauty and the duality is that if one space is too hard you go to the other space so this is really fun and this is then um the i sort of have this grand opus paper uh the dob21 you're like she refers to it all the time okay so the goal right so i said you're gonna have this pro emergent thing which is like has multiple emergent times going on it's not just emergent time but i think they're all over the place so in that is what i'm gonna call v stack time so um a stack is going to be this particular object that takes um values in categories not just sets so we're not looking at like the set of continuous functions but maybe you're looking at the category um of you know of continuous functions and every object in the category is a continuous function so you're getting this sort of grand unified view um of of objects which is really really neat i say v because it's it's going to be a stack with a v topology on it i think i spoke last time that you can actually put a topology on categories and that's what i'm really interested in so the beach apology is uh peter schultz says topology that he's using for the diamonds and it's um it's a nice fine topology and i'll go into it a little bit so the big questions that are driving some kind of you know wild diagram that i have here in the middle this con d diamond is like what is the mathematics of simultaneity so i'm really interested in what we mean by simultaneity and we say two events happen quote at the same time what time is that um and is there a difference and what is the difference between simultaneity and non-locality non-locality you know you have spatial non-locality maybe the view from a pair of entangled photons um and then what does temporal non-locality mean that time is actually everywhere that there is no difference in time between events right you have events that are maybe spread out into space but maybe they happen at the same time so i'm really interested in what kind of mathematics would be able to hold something like that right maybe you have a bunch of multiplicities going on but they're all at once so um you know i'm asking what is embodied cognition in non-locality how could you actually reframe one of the fundamental tenets of like active inference based on like reframe it and non-locality not a progression but what would actually happen all at once so this is where i think um you know the mathematics would actually help like infinity categories and this double emergence that i'm talking about so i talked about infinity categories last time these are categories that have a lot of a lot of rich structure in them and you're able to create morphisms uh between morphisms and between morphisms all the way up to infinity morphisms which is really really beautiful so maybe the claim maybe it's kind of a wild claim is that embody cognition like is emergent time right so um what am i gonna you know hopefully that's something that can i can kind of show throughout these slides in body cognition like is um emergent time so again the basis behind emergent time is was it always here i don't i don't know was time always here who knows and that's what i'm kind of after so in this diagram you see i have the spa fq which is the attic spectrum i'm going to go into on the other side you have spa qp which is the attic spectrum of the p addicts the diamond interpretation with a little diamond on top you've got these two factorization maps these xps from fargs work on his geometrization of the local language so heavy math in this um which is really beautiful on the bottom you've got this y diamond se these are um this is called the diamond interpretation of the fog fontaine curve this is an attic curve that has an actual forbinius action on it and so this curve is very important it's used in the language program which is a you know the top a grand unified theory of mathematics right now so then you have these ln maps that are mapping up whatever up means into what i call condensed tea diamond so the condensed category is uh peter schultz's construction about category of condensed objects i'm gonna go into those it's a beautiful idea about sheaves over points so anybody in the crowd who knows what a sheep is it's like a awesome topological way of keeping track of local data local data liquid data local data like a little bag and um so i can't like normally um you don't you have shaves over spaces but here's an actual chief over a singular point and so he's uh he and um uh um dustin claussen have been like putting together this really um awesome uh lecture notes on this topic so it's great it's in its embassy and i think it's great so that d diamond is um a conjecture of mine that you take the diamond i talked about last time and you can actually extend it to the infinity category of diamonds so i call that d-dime a lot of stuff in that diagram but this is you know what i think is actually the aesthetic uh because it you know what if we could actually map this to like um you know a string theoretic interpretation or something then you get the grand unified theory of math and physics boom okay so um let me open that just a little bit so if you take uh let c be the category of diamonds like condensed c be the category of condensed objects in c objects are condensed diamonds right that's what's in there um let r be the reflective full subcategory of condensed c this is a subcategory where all objects and are actually reflections of objects in uh the bigger category so it's very neat we have diamonds and they're reflections so objects in our reflections so if you take d diamond to be the infinity one category of diamonds you can extend this to conde diamond so condensed e diamond and you get this actual um object so following precedent from fargs amazing work uh the fiber product of this diagram is claimed a modulized space and a diamond that's very hard all right so that's uh that's hard so modulai of v stack time so let's take this condensed diamond and just up it just a little bit so i have this other conjecture right let's take um so the way that you get these diamonds oh i don't have a figure all right i have the figure of a diamond very very soon the way you get the diamond is by taking equivalence classes uh certain prohibited equivalence classes of these objects called perfectoid spaces which are like berkovich space it's kind of like cancer objects and so you glue those together and you get a diamond well why don't we glue diamonds together and get something else so you can do that so if you can take diamond equivalence relations of this diamond curve then you can get a stack and the v topology and then why don't we work in the modulized space of v stack so modular space is this awesome parameter space where each point represents an isomorphism class of objects so you're looking at so each point like in this little figure below um is uh an isomorphism class and so the question is like uh you know how do you move in a diagram like that is it a chess board is it can i only move this way and this way and this way so i'm really interested in like what it means phenomenologically to have something like this and to start in the upper left like dot and jump to the like the bottom right dot so how do you actually move through this thing so i'm thinking that every point of that moduli space would actually be an incarnation of the condensed d diamond diagram so that that huge factorization with these maps would actually be each point and i think that's actually really beautiful so that's the type of like grand unified theory i'm kind of thinking of um yeah so these ln maps play a dual role of what's called topological localization localization is a beautiful phenomenon a beautiful way of actually constructing equivalences between um between objects and so topological localization passes through this reflective subcategory so objects are being sort of stared at by their reflections and it's a way of getting more equivalences and maps so i'll just leave that at that so this pro terminology this is a little mathy but i thought you know we're let's do it i'm not going to go supermathy but i want to give you enough terms so you know like what i'm talking about so for this pro which i think is very cool the idea is that emergence is built into the very space as a pro object and not as additional counter terms i think the ai community the active inference community does that as well you want everything sort of built into the structure as opposed to adding these uh counter terms there's a lot of beautiful like feynman path integral work that has all of these additional counter terms um added to it and it's like i wish it could just be built into the actual space so you can actually do that with this pro terminology right so a pro object all this is um there's a great reference called in cat lab that has all these definitions so i'm pulling all these um and lots of great lecture notes on any kind of pro object so what is a pro object a pro object of a category c is a formal co-filtered limit of objects of c so basically roughly um what we mean by this co-filtered limit is that for every two objects c1 c2 and c you have a third object c3 and c that they both get mapped to it so it's sort of self-contained you see it's built into the structure you don't have to go off and leave the category to find the limit so you have a hom functor um also so what you do you take s to be a closed symmetric manoidal category closed um i have the definition for both of these symmetric minority means it has a tensor product and you take c and s in rich category which means that it takes values um the harm set of c takes values in s so you have this enriched hom functor which is written like this c takes in two pairs um going from the product of c opposite with itself whereas the opposite is the same category the arrows are just reversed 2s that sends a pair of objects in c to this hum object which is a collection of morphism so look at that you're actually mapping each pair of objects to where it can go right to all the possible paths and i think this is very nice so a closed category means for any pair cc prime of objects the collection of morphisms is an actual object of c so everything is inside of itself and it's sort of like a categorical closure property right if anyone's familiar with just the closure property of um that you learn in like you know abstract algebra so this is called the internal hom object right so um five the pro functor so with the pro terminology you can actually have a profunctor which generalizes the word uh term functor so let's c and d both be enriched over c the pro-functor from c to d is an s functor so it's enriched uh with d op um tensor c over s so again taking the pairs and mapping them over so you can also make this into like i told you this modulized space right right here with the points where isomorphism classes um are each point and they can vary geometrically and i'll go into what that means um and you can get stacks from that so i think i'll finish the pro and then ask if there's any questions daniel just to wrap up this this pro okay before yeah let's get the supers techy stuff out of the way um all right so what's also beautiful and uh all over the language program is the idea of a pro finite group so you can either you can take this pro language this kind of multi-gluing and self-containedness and extend it to a profinite group which is a topological group that's isomorphic to the inverse limit of an inverse system of discrete finite groups so you have this inverse limit over the discrete finite groups these are finite groups that they all have the discrete topology and you have a collection of homomorphisms that satisfy nice relations so my idea is like okay let's let's let's up the game even more there's a lot of work about spectra and prime spectra and this is also growth in d where the spectrum of a ring i think i talked about it last time um is a certain um the spectrum of ring refers is a space where the actual points of the space refer to prime ideals so again you have this like point referring to something higher than a point okay so you can extend that to what i call a formal spectrum so gothic had this great idea of like including infinitesimals and things so it's not like you have a singular now but what if we had a singular noun with a little bit of infinitesimal thickening on it right like every every now or every like local time of ours had a little bit of thickening and we could call that an infinitesimal thickening and so um he actually has the same idea and he calls it formal spectra so we say the formal spectrum spuf r of a community of ring r and as an ideal that obeys certain properties it's actually the inductive limit of the prime spectrum so inductive limit um meaning like this so uh the the pro refers to a projective phenomena on the end refers to an inductive so it's like a co-limit so spf r is the co limit of spec r um i n which is um the where r is complete with the i attic topology there's various ways of completing rings in the i attic so um where the connective morphisms are these closed nil potent immersions spec r-i-n immersed with spec uh r i n plus one so these are of affine schemes and the co-limit is taken in the category of topologically ringed spaces so uh what is a what is a closed nilpotenum not a available sheath which is again this kind of thickening thing so imagine a space with a little bit of like skin on it and so i'm thinking that okay it's not just a pro emergence of points it's a pro emergence of these formal spectra which are like times intervals with little thickenings on them so nilput and elephants uh and i say elephants and no nail pold and elephants nilpoten elements are our infinitesimal neighborhoods and so a beautiful way to complete again to complete the ring you know having convergence issues like settled is to actually take added completion so added completion is to actually have all the infinite testable neighborhoods at once and i think that's a grand goal and anybody after added completion to have all the thickenings right um is what is probably what we should be after any questions on that so far before i get to the fun just like i yep okay thanks for this um interesting intro i think one thing that's really gonna resonate with people hopefully of all different backgrounds is what you said about we want emergence built into the base structure of our model not a counter term which isn't a term that's familiar to me but it's kind of like magic shouldn't be added at the higher level we should have a model where at the base level we have emergence and then you um mentioned the pairs of objects and a few different kind of pair operations like inverses and so i was just wondering how should we think about these pairs of objects for example are they organisms in the niche or are they two organisms because if so then we can kind of think every time you say pair we might be able to like map it on to something that that we've talked about from the embodied cognitive perspective oh i like that yeah go ahead try that try that um you know well you could take you know the category c of organisms and then it could be um any two organisms in the actual category if you wanted the category you know to be um you know pairs of organisms like uh the organism daniel an organism shanna or something different then you could actually construct the category to be that that's the beauty of category theory you construct it to be whatever you want because structurally you know the goal the goal is to get everything built inside the actual space and to have these consistency issues that you're not like oh well yeah you know so like uh we come online and then there's this counter term oops so you actually have it um where organism you know is relating to or interacting with like organism right or you could actually have a category b just the way that my organism is identifying and interpreting information like whatever you want those objects to be it's completely loose cool thanks and i'll relay any questions from live chat in another 10 slides yay awesome okay this is so great yay so we're all on the same page um you know built it build it into the structure you know and if you want the structure centered around you know you can actually have this c3 being like the organism daniel the organism shanna that everything maps back to me because that's what we're doing right inactive everything comes back to me i'm trying to process um okay cool all right so um okay this is a i don't know these ideas may just all be wild but i'm glad you know i'm here to help right so i don't know this is where my brain thinks okay so we have the idea of an infomorphism which is an actual pair of an adjoint pair of functors that's on a chew space and my colleague my great colleague chris fields has done so much work with that you know chris fields pairs with levin all the time they come up with this great step so an infomorphism is one pair one set of adjoint uh functors which um um which satisfy some information my idea is to make a two infomorphism from these six functor formulas so in these kind of wild equations down here the two tails is is a structural property an internal hom and an actual tensor product how you actually combine things but the four in the middle represent two pairs of adjoint functors so if one set of two pairs is infomorphism i just want to actually construct a two infomorphism which would actually be a morphism between morphism so that's a categorical thing at this point we're working on the semantics of what that actually means right now and so bear with us that should be out very very soon so what is this the idea is the incarnation of global time emerges from diamond non-locality what i just tried to say local time emerges from these singular condensed sets the two infomorphism is going to connect the global time with the local time that's the whole point right that's how your organism evolves right uh that's how you deduce is to connect your local time with what's actually happening globally right these cannot be singularly they have to intersect at some point so if this two infomorphism can actually do that then you can actually get this temporal simultaneity non-locality i'm still not convinced that there is a difference between simultaneity and non-locality i would love it for anyone and you're um you know if anyone's um like interested in that that's that's really that's tricky because uh maybe maybe the instance of simultaneity is a slice of the non-locality or maybe we were actually in tune enough with what's happening like um like embodied cognition-wise or whatever that we were actually able to access for just a second maybe the true non-locality of everything that is the non-locality of information whatever you want to call it what is the difference i don't really know uh people normally refer to like special relativity in reference frames and i i have a couple questions about what reference frames are so um anytime you know i i think i'm gonna tackle a new subject i invent a new dictionary i'm like okay let's start with a dictionary to actually translate what i'm talking about okay so the notion of a site in category theory is where i can put a topology so i'm thinking if i'm you know for instance looking at the site over you know organism you know investigating its environment something like this the site of shanna that couldn't that's a categorical categorical way of actually um referring to the localization phenomena and the collapse right so quantum mechanics is saying you go from you know the collapse of the wave function is uh great i go from a simultaneous like super position state to like a localized now of course there's you know controversy about the collapse and things like that that's why i'm using the word localization you localize and then now so um coupling perturbation right so again strong coupling you have to use these um um these non-perturbative methods weak coupling you can use perturbation there's a i think there's a link between perturbation and this perfectoid stuff that i've been looking at so there's a way called uh called tilting to go from uh characteristic zero if people are familiar with that to characteristic p you can also add these beautiful objects called uh p divisible formal group laws uh which are um uh you know once again uh i would say ways of connecting like groups um the kernels of these actual maps are p to the end torsion so the torsion element um actually annihilates any other element so an element is torsion if it actually um is annihilated by another element so you can see that you have these p to the n sort of phenomena that are canceling terms so the whole idea is that you can get this cancellation and sort of a sequence phenomena um also in perpecute spaces so there's also torsion in these objects called shimura varieties which we'll talk about later that's in the language conjecture strong coupling maybe it's strong uh you know maybe in the diamond we could say strong coupling is in the diamond side of the holography because there's many incarnations of these covers spa cd and i'll go into this a little bit later just trying to put the ideas up front weak coupling right so maybe you can do perturbation phenomena um in the condensed setting uh in the interior um you know so maybe that's in the singular perfectoid time it's weak because it's uh you know condensed maybe it's easier to work with protel covers than in the condensed setting so it would make you work in the conformal field theory which is the diamonds so the whole relation to the diamond holography is that if you have these six operations right in the bulk then you're gonna have to go from the bulk to the conformal field so maybe the inside is the six operations uh you know um whichever one you want to call strong and we coupling so what do i what do i need to finish well you need to like to i need to actually take the six operations and put them in the condensed setting and then link the diamond profinite conditions with non-locality so you get what's called diamond descent descent is another way like daniel was saying about keeping the the system contained the scent is a way of actually making sure that the covering spaces can can reconstruct the lower space so my local space is actually constructable from my glow my global space and vice versa this is another way of keeping the structure built inside the actual space okay and we'll talk about diamond localization which is going to be a way to make relations between the various diamonds all right so let's try to link this right so we're calling infomorphism it's an adjoint pair of structure preserving maps for a choose space the beauty about two spaces it's got a very very nice construction categorically the chew constructions build builds what's called a star autonomous category this is a monoidal category it has a tensor product in them to help help you move nav objects around where all objects have duals right so i thought this might be interesting from embodied cognition because maybe you're looking around at your reflection and learning off of your reflection right and where are these reflections everywhere so if all objects have duals that's a very strong property for a category which is why there's a lot of type theory and stuff that works in the choose space so you also have a category five forbinius algebra this is an associative algebra with a linear form on it i told you furbinius was even in the langlens right so furbinius is powerful in body cognition everything is related right so you want everything to be related so what if what if everything was a star autonomous category so i think the true construction is actually very pertinent here so if the hidden states what if those are like a pro finite condition or a pro object that maybe just only become uh you know visible upon a certain pullback so in the diamond construction that i gave you i said those those geometric points were mathematical impurities yeah that they were not visible unless you pulled them back over these covers there's once again a lot of work um about neurology um acting topologically meaning that you your proprioception is gotten by these topological covers where portions of the mind or the brain are actually working uh together um and where where portions sort of intersect and overlap that's a that's a covering phenomenon and that's how you actually um deduce and things like this so shared action okay okay so if we were if we're after shared action you know what if we start looking at relations between relations that's where the shared action is we want to think collectively yeah in the face of uncertainty if we start thinking in the framework of two morphism then you're already in the global space and i think there's nothing more shared than working in the relation of the relation space instead of being so siloed you can be silent in your own localization but that's not going to help for shared action you need to actually so if everyone can get a hold of everyone else's two morphisms you know what does that mean that means they're actually all intersecting and interacting um you can take that and go to in awareness which is what my awesome colleague robert prentner and i have been working on as well that you know i i'm not sure i think i said that last time but i do not believe that there's only one channel here right i feel like through uh shared action you could access more of these sort of consciousness channels um and so the an awareness is actually a categorical phenomenon that i can show here so i think i showed this last time but i'll just show it again so on the left you have a basic uh depiction of a category this one right here my little mouse is like not working all right so the one on the left uh top row left so you have um two um two objects here a and b f1 and g1 amorphisms right you have two objects c and d um f2 and g2 are those are morphisms we'll call them one morphisms let's go to the category in the middle so the category middle is a two category oh and i'm sorry the category on the left is a one category so if you go to a two category in the middle you have the same objects a b c d and the same one one morphism but look at these wild maps on the side so you're mapping uh look look what we're mapping on the left you're mapping the morphism f1 to g2 by that map fee and then you're also by gamma you're mapping a g uh g1 to f2 so this is awesome so look what we're doing there now you're mapping the morph isn't between the morphisms and this is where i think shared action lives you can go even wilder because you know it's me um so the third the third cat you can have a three category um which is the top right piece and look at that a three category consists of objects one morphisms between the objects two morphisms between the one morphisms and then look at the three morphism you have going on the big double bar a triple bar horizontal bar that's connecting fee and gamma is there racy so you see you can just keep going and why not that's where collection yeah go ahead oh just wanted to give one little thought on this it's almost like yes let's say a b c d are people and then the two mapping is kind of like best friends or marriage it's like two people who are married there's some parallelism between couples of married people and then the three is like the mapping between marriage and being a best friend and so it's like saying the relationship between person a and b in the marriage is like the relationship between a and b in the best friend relationship so it's like we can put the relationship and almost objectify it but not in a demeaning way just in a containing formal way and then use that to build higher order relationships so this is like very interesting look at that yeah you say it i should just give you my slides and you present it's a co it's a co-presentation and we as in as a dyad are interacting with the material you've prepared as well as any questions that anyone else brings wow and so does everyone see so like collectively oh that makes me excited so collectively like even this interaction is like a three morphism right now and so that's actually really cool and you see um i like the yeah the with like marriage maybe you know maybe if you stayed in the one category you would have just been friends and you would have never actually tried the other relationship or the other relationship or you can go like you know twin flames and all this kind of stuff and so it's actually really exciting and so you can see just like daniel's saying that's shared action and let's like let's take shared action to infinity and then what a beautiful place this would be you know you kind of have like you know the people like me that are you know related to animals too so it'd be like oh okay so then you have the morphism between like the theta wave of the animals talking to like the humans and then like oceans and things like that and then you might start relating on the higher like higher um connection level right not hierarchical but like a higher connection level and so you can see that uh robert and i were trying to think okay let's let's get weird and like take you know the one level of awareness which is like uh you know daniel and i co-presenting here because he's says my slide's better than me so the the co-presentation right is maybe like a one awareness okay and then two awareness let's let's just bump this up a little bit would be that you know he and i are presenting here and then simultaneously like we're both cambridge apostles what yes that's the level that i'm willing to go right because if time is non-local which i sort of think it is why can't we map to it using these morphisms right of course we'd have to do i don't know some kind of partition in the brain or whatever but we'll get to that later but that's what we're saying about this nested hierarchy so use the same uh everything that daniel's saying about the categories right one category two category three category and bump it to like awareness meaning actual interaction like let's take in body cognition and bump it like what would a two embodied cognition be a three embodied and let's keep going up because that would require higher higher levels of this awareness this stacky thing and again the beauty about this is that look we didn't add some counter term right we didn't just add uh you know the whole thing is magic of course and you know i love magic but we didn't just add it out of nowhere this was like built into the actual structure which i think is cool so again most people may be um intimidated by category theory or whatever at the first but it's like i think there's a payoff it's like let's let's put a little bit of work into that structure and then you can make this aesthetic and it actually i think it helps you know so um just an overview real quick i'm going to try to talk about this uh you know this emergent time a little better and a concomitant theory of condensed types which are proposedly they're supposed to be immediate from the recently introduced diamond holographic principle you've seen me already kind of introduced that so if you're connecting this beautiful mathematical grand unified theory of geometrized local language in the stack language with emergent time that would be a new incarnation of a new reciprocity law you see i'm using the word incarnation to refer to diamonds and reflections yeah also choose spaces infomorphism star autonomous all of this star autonomous objects having duals reflections reflective subcategories pro finite condition it's all about the mirror phenomena which is in embodied cognition i think of course there's problems everywhere which is why i'm excited about this right problems everywhere you know you're going to talk about a theory of emergent time how do you measure that how do you actually measure time without constructing it and that that is like that's huge that'll stump me you know i talk fast i'm like wait wait so how do you how do you measure a double emergent something as crazy as i'm talking about how do you measure a pro emergence how do you measure like you know if you want to do this categorical construction like we're doing a two emergence a three emergence i don't know and that's what i hope to so like we can all work together to figure this out how do you actually measure emergence it's like do you collapse emergence are you too late if you measure it too early is it a partial emergence and you've missed it if we sneeze do we miss it is it fast you know so our model gives levels of non-locality levels of non-locality not just saying like you know there exists a spatial non-locality no if you can put them together in that formal spectra what if you had levels of non-locality everywhere and that's sort of what i'm into so i call it like a stacking on locality and stackification i think stockification is a word like spaghettification it does exist i may have misspelled it sorry all right so you can do local this you know i'm interested um one of your um awesome um um members of the community was asking me about like what are you talking about this local global meaning like the local singular now is like where i'm existing now and then of course you know you have your unicorns constellation time monoceros and all this other stuff so that's what there's a play here between taking an information and then like existing and stuff so you can do this by this diamond descent i told you this gluing and that's going to be an infinity one version of spatial v descent which is that peter schultz's work diamond localization so what's already neat is that once again when i talked about the emergence is built into the structure this localization those l maps in the reflective subcategory it's already a descent condition whoa so let's use these beautiful theorems right and actually use them for phenomenology for phenomenology and so that's already a descent condition so we're on our way you know so the goals to actually link like strong and weak coupling how do you actually construct this diamond non-locality for a temporal multiplicity i think that's really in tune with embodied cognition is to have a multiplicitous time meaning like there is not just one but it's what how could you actually model time acting globally non-locally but also in a multiple way and that's super french continental philosophy at that point and i you know that's like my upbringing so i'm really interested in this phenomenal multiplicity because it lee it lets the individual be and it makes like one of body cognition is like what i feel it is so i'll have to build this diamond descent and then again these v stacks are going to have to satisfy this gluing condition that's fine our model is a double emergence but it's pro finitely many copies of emergence that's what's strange i told you last time a pro finite set was a totally disconnected compact has um hazdorf space so that's uh that's uh what like what is that you know um um what a totally disconnected um compact space not hazdwarf so but so the profinite is very strange it's like what is that if you have profanity many copies of something what is that actual space so if you have this double emergence and it's very kind of fractal like um i'm really interested in that so again maybe the strong coupling has to do with irreversibility and reconstructability i'm very very interested and what we mean by you know something is irreversible right i think we need to go into that just a little bit more um and is there a play between irreversibility and reconstructability right the descent condition says you can reconstruct this higher space from this global space what does it mean that you if you like fail to reconstruct so we say is the diamond x like reconstructable up to irreversibility you've seen the up to condition in in mathematics which is like a is sort of equal to b up to some condition meaning con considering that condition so the hope is that yes so if i can get this play between reconstructability and irreversibility maybe that'll make more sense mathematically for what it means to be irreversible so coupling the strength of the coupling would be in the levels of the profiniteness and the non-locality how many levels do you actually have there what's those strength so coupling by perturbation i already said that's perfectoid and tilting so big questions what would actually non-locality be an act of reference i want to leave these rhetorically because i want to get to this um um that pretty image daniel before we wait for pause to the next question so and i think it's like coming up yeah it's right there okay so what is non-locality and active inference what is holography an active inference right which is this very awesome dimensional phenomena where there's a strong interaction and you know say dimension n and then maybe there's like a weaker interaction and n minus one what does that mean and that if one space is too difficult you go to the other space what does that actually mean and they're actually related sort of like a hologram so hologram is this 2d kind of scrambled image that maybe you bounce light on and you get this 3d phenomena so in one sense the 3d is redundant because you already had it in 2d so what is the notion of redundancy and active inference that's what i'm interested in so what is the diamond equivalent of pro finite an active insert where's the fractalness that's sort of happening right the fractal multiplicity what is object persistence and active inference that's tricky right so um you know when we you know we say you know the observer measures the electron and things like this um you know the pair of entangled photons you know acts non-locally or something like this what does that actually mean why is it the same photon and so uh chris fields and are trying to work on this awesome idea of object persistence of what that actually is right i mean you saw me a couple weeks ago right but is it the same shanna how does that work how does objects persistence work when you're going through like a multiple time you know what is emergent time and active inference where is it more likely where in embodied like cognition is emergence so what is pro emergence there so i want you to think about these as we're kind of going through what is a singularity right in active inference like a singular event what is coupling right what is the actual coupling what does the strength of an interaction mean so if you want a player for shared action amid global uncertainty maybe we should work in discrete time operating grand unified theories master this local global localization by these higher order awarenesses machine learning right operating grain unified theories let's go higher right let's not work in networks anymore let's work in three morphisms medical okay let's model the brain as a hologram maybe these thoughts or these certain chromatic towers i talked about the the chromatic homotope theory last time it has this beautiful notion um of um equating spectra you have this notion of uh this theorem called chromatic convergence theorem that says that you can recon you can reconstruct a certain object from its towers of spectra so you have a boost field localization which which is sort of like um the idea of my top the topological localization i referred to which is a way of sort of connecting spaces and um again if if you know you know if in certain neurological maybe degeneration maybe the actual morphisms are cut you know you can think about things like that you're no longer able to recall because maybe all the maps are gone right so maybe that you could more aptly model things like enterograde amnesia and neurodegeneration so medical level and uh 11 and fields have this awesome um kind of new workout about entanglement across daughter cells what is holography and daughter cells at least it's you know at least we can measure entanglement in something besides photons you know so you need this particularity um is temporal non-locality is it like instantiation without reciprocity advent right this is me going like wild here so advent means that you've arrived but in been in body cognition if the environment has arrived i've arrived this is double play right so is it an instantaneousness without a sort of two-way interaction what does that actually mean what does temporal non-locality mean i don't really know can we actually construct for instance a pro-finite version of that which is again this kind of super-disconnected fractal space is temporal non-locality dialethism time everyone knows i'm a super fan of dialethism this is a construction of logic where you can have both a and not a at the same time normally you cannot right you have a you know uh you know a or b a they're you know not a therefore b why can't a and not a obtain at the same time so you get this beautiful construction called dialethism we may start messing around in that so it is does a diamond construction of temporal non-locality fail time as it fails all pro incarnations of duration so you can get a lot of interesting heavy questions with this if so what are the actual conditions for object persistence in a non-locality that is pro finite how do you actually do that right how does something persist um in those conditions how does persistence work in a singular case such as anterograde amnesia you know i spoke of clive waring last time um you know was a beautiful pianist um he's still living which is great but he got an anterior grade amnesia and has no more personal memory but has a motor memory and so there's um you know some some difficulties there but it's very interesting how the memory levels work so the question is multiply profound so at least try to hold on to it you know with a small assessment maybe this has to do with like with thoughts and memory recollection and we can go into that but first a dream oh go ahead kind of just make a few active inferences yes there do it okay so i'm uh recalling my thoughts here by looking at the paper which i took notes on um first you mentioned the dynamic persistence and the multi-scale persistence and that reminded me of the ship of theseus which is like if you replace all the planks of the ship is it the same ship so it's a philosophy styled question and then we're approaching it in a formal way and then it comes very close to active inference when you had the slide a needed particularity that reminded me of carl fristen's recent paper which was called a free energy principle for a particular physics and particular is a pun because it means specific but also it means particle and so when we say a particle or a point it's like that is the unit of analysis that we can pick up we can make edges between points and we can engage in a higher level of network mapping so when we're thinking about particles here and this way that particles can be related in nested uh models or nested categories i'm not sure what technical word would be we're kind of talking about a particular approach oh i love this yeah just trying to give a little little active inference you know throw out some redness no please yeah every ten slides every five stop me yes i i think wow how neat you see that's like an incarnation it's like this this this is uh this is exciting yeah what a play that's perfect i'm curious to see what you think about the next couple slides um okay i say but first right so you have all this mathy stuff we're gonna do this we're gonna do this you know uh like daniel said we're probably going fristen stop pulling at everybody's stuff ship of theseus but first a dream because i want to get like a little pretty so we are interested in the relation between diamond descent the stop mechanism so i know uh fields and levin and everyone has been like baffled by that uh the stop mechanism that you know doesn't work in something like cancer cells yeah when when do things stop i'm actually very curious about that um and the storage and reflection and recollection of profanity many copies of information in the form of mathematically and pure geometric points right if you're modeling um you know neurons as diamonds what is whoa uh okay you have covers of diamonds like i said um you know the if the proprioception is topological and in the covers then maybe you could actually model neurons as these diamond phenomena so um someone like clive wearing has all the diamonds but the the covers are cut so it's almost like you cannot access that right very interesting when the actual you know balloons are cut you cannot get the balloon anymore if they're attached to you so we posited a model of the brain that's actually allowing for various mathematical partitions in the brain in the form of uh profoundly many copies of the diamond right so the neurons are geometric points which are morphisms of schemes like i said then maybe anterograde amnesia would resemble some kind of sustained truncation of diamond descent why are those maps continually continuously cut which is why i'm very interested in this object persistence so considering temporal non-calorie can we model thoughts as pro-finite reflections of pro-tell topological covers oriented and non-locality right someone from your um from your community also has asked me about thoughts and i was like that's such a great question what you know clearly there's something like there's an em field going on but it's something more than that and then the brain seems to operate like a hologram as well so what is that right are these actual the pro finite reflections you know like if you cannot organize your thoughts or things bouncing all over the place um you know there's a lot of people that are internal or the you know is the the diamond super internally reflected at that point so this may help i said you know to model the state of being fully conscious right during dreamless sleep no one has that uh fully conscious during the dreamless sleep what would that actually be um which perhaps takes the form of sleeping in a diamond hourglass so um you know i write like kind of fantastical mathematical fiction books and this is my second one that i'm working on about you know sleeping and a diamond hourglass what does that actually mean so you're working in diamond time at that point what does that mean profinitely many reflections of time which probably takes some kind of image like this right so i always have unicorns over because i'm like oh it's magic right and what does that actually mean to sleep inside of anything hourglass i'm very very curious because you know when we go to sleep nothing is really asleep your system is still functioning right but quote where do you go and i'm not sure what you know i'm gonna put that out there to the your community what is that right why can you not be fully conscious during dreamless sleep not the little brief periodics right of uh of dream sleep that you get but where is that so it'd be something like sleeping in an hourglass which is actually very strange and he's like oh god what if somebody takes the hourglass and turns it upside down and shakes it okay you know um but this would almost be an hourglass without cardinality so there is no up or down here you know and so um stay tuned that book is coming out soon okay which is cool but it's all it's nested in in the pro finite condition if you're going to say object persistence that happens when you sleep as well so to get to some of the mathy stuff there's some main conjectures i'll talk about the fm k theory of diamonds um let's let's actually look up that diamond shape again um and let's get into the diamond holographic principle the fard fontaine curve why we're using a telecoilmology and let's get to emergent time you know or as far as many of these as we can so um i may start skipping around daniel on the interest of time you know so that we can get to the good stuff so i introduced this kind of wild um conjecture about you know this epimof k theory of diamonds in this localization sequence which is a co-fiber sequence and a modification of something called continuous k theory so again i told you earlier that maybe continuous k theory is the way to go if we're going to be modeling emergent time because you want to kind of stick together small pockets of of local emergence so this uh this number two uh localization sequence is a co-fiber sequence and uh you've got the the k theory acting on the little sub diamond and then k ephemoth of the diamond farc fontaine curve uh mapping to the ephemoth k theory of the non-diamond uh fog fontaine curve with a modification of this f continuous um working in the the category of sheaves and this is actually um this third um left-hand side is actually going to be corresponded to the actual that that omega to the n is an actual continuous k theory spectrum of d diamond so again it's a way of actually gluing together and looking at the like isomorphism classes of what's happening in these diamonds so again my idea is this you have these profinitely many copies uh that of of uh the actual geometric impurities so you already have those and we actually want to figure out what's happening between those so like what's a two morphism between the profinite copies that's what my interpretation of the k theory is going to be so you have this level let's go up a higher level k theory is actually looking at what makes things like unified at that higher level so it's cool so this d um upper diamond is the stable dualizable presentable infinity one category of diamonds d sub diamonds actually the complex of v stacks of locally spatial diamonds where complex is a um sort of like a collection and then you have the actual relative farc fontaine curve and the dye so i don't want to talk about that too too much let's get to the actual diamond holography principle but the diamond holographic principle should fall out and be immediate from this localization sequence so once again our diamond holographic principle is going to use these two adjoint pairs where these uh you have a direct image an inverse image functor and then an exceptional um and an inverse exceptional functor which is this uh f lower shriek and f upper streak that's the kind of cool way of saying exclamation point what's the main point is that um again we want to take these double adjoint pairs and make a two infomorphism out of them so these are from schultz's six operations they tell chromology of diamonds um we'll actually want to condensify this so how do you rephrase all this in terms of a sheaf of sets like on a certain site i'm gonna go into what that means and then sort of uh you know how do how do we think about holography in terms of a mathematically uh mathematical impurity geometric point the spa cd that's the attic spectrum of this closed algebraic curve mapping to the actual diamond so again try to think of uh you know when we think about reflections we're trying to mathematically interpret that so let's actually discuss emergent time from that condensed setting and investigate a condensed version of the actual continuous k theory for pro emergence right that's wild so the continuous k theory right so let's use up them off continuous k3 and then actually try to put the pro object together as a pro emergence okay so here's this um image i think i showed it last time so the one of the main goals is to actually have an infinity one categorification of geometrical england's the language program is so beautiful what is it trying to do it's um you know it's a mathematical interpretation of shared action you are working across very difficult disparate fields um with lots of uncertainty and um so you have these beautiful phenomena called langlin's reciprocity langlin's functoriality we're actually you know uh you're creating a certain situation in which um you know certain representations of objects are actually automorphic forms and so different incarnations are being shown to be the same thing which is like a a version of the same thing which is cool so in this um model that i have here so the diamonds in the middle and again you have the fmof k theory of the actual diamond curve and at the bottom you know i said oh this structure is you know possibly an infinity one to poi which goes back to daniel's point about bringing all the structure in so uh an infinity one toe poi is infinity one category it satisfies a descent condition it's locally cartesian closed so everything maps to each other it's got a kappa filter on it so everything is nice and contained which is really nice all right and so you can also these lns can also be interpreted in terms of i have a little note there about a lube and tape formal sheath module this is a law to link once again one of these higher grain unified theories you could actually maybe link the geometerization of local langlens with fmof k3 so i'm just putting some supermathy things because some people wanted some mathy things all right so um that's weinstein's work which is really pretty so let me actually formally define diamond i don't think i did last time um yeah and then we get to the actual holography part okay so let perf d be the category of perfectoid spaces so again these are attic spaces they look like huber spaces and um they are fractal and strange kind of like berkovic spaces so the let perf d be that category and perf be the subcategory perfectoid spaces of characteristic p so no longer zero p so a diamond is a probitel sheath that's a sheaf in the protel topology which i told you it's a very fine topology which can be written as a quotient um you know x mod r so it's of a you take the perfectoid space and you mod out you glue by these protel equivalence relations boom you get a diamond what a beautiful way of doing that so we say let c be an algebraically closed aphenoid field um it's a certain construction and the uber sentence and then we say geometric points this is the thing that i think would be beautiful to actually the thing this is the actual object that could actually model neurons very nicely geometric point the which is the attic spectrum of that c mapping to the diamond is made visible by pulling it back through a pro-ital cover x to d resulting in profiling many copies of spa c so this is again a huge relation with like um proprioception by topology right how do you actually visualize how do you interpret things like this so diamond is an actual algebraic space for that beach apology and the v topology if anyone wants to know is this actual cover f i x i x um that consists of any maps x i to x such that for any uh quasi compact uh open subset u and x you have finite indices i so that these um these open subsets jointly uh cover you so x there is an actual um uh v stack okay so here's the diamond again right so um we can think what are these actual geometric points in terms of like embody cognition in terms of you know um um you know shared action whatever you want to think if if i you know if i'm a diamond daniel's how do you actually relate those two diamonds by these like big maps and so you can see that right here you have this diamond so um the the actual footnote is calling it what it is so you take the p addicts right which is the field of p at x q p we can if we want to find the diamond spectrum of that which is that spod d so the diamond spectrum that's akin to the actual prime spectrum of the attic spectrum i showed you so you can actually only ever get the attic spectrum of qp cycloatomic which is the cycloatomic field of the p addicts you don't actually get all the p addicts so this uh modded out by this zp cross which is a galwa action um it's it's underlined because it's pro finite so how interesting that you never actually get you want the left-hand side spotty qp but you only get profoundly many copies of the cycloatomic so you never actually get what you're after and this is actually has a lot of phenomenology behind it because like again robert and i really and chris and i are really fascinated by the phenomenology of what is so if we actually have you know um if you want to think interface or if you want to think whatever it is in our organism are we actually ever truly interacting with the thing or just our representation of the thing um you know you've got me at the level going well you know if interaction is just me interacting with a reflection of my environment if it's actually me interacting with hidden states that were probably my reflections the whole time um what is it are we just sitting around with the profinet many copies of the thing and we never actually get the thing any questions for for um i feel like that's a lot of math yeah there's a question in the chat oh wonderful yep uh cb writes according to this fascinating framework and from an awareness perspective is the dark room problem still considered as a problem grateful for any elaboration on that and thanks to the speaker so the dark room problem being um the philosophical thought experiment where what does an agent in a dark room do and in the free energy world some people initially several years ago brought that up as something like a critique they'd say well aren't you very precisely sure that you're in a dark room so if active inference is about reducing uncertainty then isn't that the perfect state but of course the pragmatic answer is that while you're in that dark room your uncertainty about the world is increasing so i'm wondering if that maps on to a multi-level uncertainty concept because it's almost like you're getting precise at the visual level that you're in a dark room but you're getting increasingly imprecise at not just a different lateral level like you're getting imprecise on smell while you're getting precise on vision but actually at a higher level you're getting imprecise on visually what's outside oh wow well yeah keep going what do you think what a beautiful question thank you so much oh yes more questions and less me talking yeah i'm just i'm uh thinking of it as there's three roads meeting in some ways here there's philosophy you know we've brought up the dark room the ship of theseus then there's a lot of the formal mathematics which certainly i'm scribbling down but are um just beginning to learn and then there's the active inference community who might be familiar with this idea of multi-level uncertainty but not have connected it to for example philosophy or math so we got people coming and going on all those roads no this is beautiful so it's like yeah yeah okay so let's not take one single dark room let's expand it if every organism had their own dark room yeah let's like let's take that question accelerated a little bit would a dark room survive in a two infomorphism right let's go a little let's let's say um you know on an information perspective is it dark probably not it's just on the organism perspective right so that's a actually the dark room is a very beautiful i think instantiation of what i'm actually saying here with the diamond so in the dark room you may just have profile many copies of the dark but is daniel saying like all your other senses are being very like perfectoided i'm just playing your other senses are being uh more fine-tuned at the expense of something else so my question is this it's like why don't why can't we increase the sort of bandwidth to be able to be precise everywhere like why is it dark to the extent of something else right um and how do we actually do that that's that's very interesting um i think i think dark room is still a problem has anybody solved that it's still a problem right i guess a problem for philosopher but not a problem for the human in the dark room and let me ask one one question on operations on diamonds yes people might be familiar with the operations on numbers like addition subtraction multiplying dividing so is it fair to say that the operations that you're going to be describing they're like ways to work with diamonds just like plus and minus are ways to work with numbers oh that's yeah okay it's a very good um very good question so you know we can answer that very abstractly that there really is no intrinsic definition of a number you can say uh the number five well what is it five times one you know six uh you know six minus one you have so many ways of going going at it that a number is actually just an equivalence class right so if a number is just an equivalence class then then you can think of the same thing as a diamond diamond is still equivalence class right a certain equivalence class between um but you're in a different a different structure so sheaves sheaves don't really add like one plus one so there's a little more yeah you can is there an algebra of sheaves oh absolutely and the beauty is that so if sheaves are this like way of keeping track of local data like a little bag that's associated to every space there are ways of gluing those together you don't really add them but you can glue them and start gluing them and start gluing them and start gluing them so in a sense they are number theoretic because if you're defining a number as an equivalence relation so you can think yeah one plus one like equals two whatever that means or you can say gluing and then gluing and then gluing and then gluing so you can actually get an infinity category of these sheaves so i recommend anyone looking at like um you wanna learn like some of the the best global mathematics and like learning it uh conceptually first is to look at the sheaf interpretation you're like wait was addition a sheath the whole time yeah talk about dark room and mathematics i'm just like yeah so operation so and so um you know bless peter for being so amazing in coming up with this idea it's like oh not only can you put a sheaf on a topological space you can put a sheaf on a category that's the sort of interesting thing that i'm into so take your idea of operating of like adding numbers and just go to the category of numbers and then if you start working categorically that's already shared action you're in this like higher space um yeah so operations with diamonds on diamonds showing something is a diamond okay it's all just a little rigorous but at the end it gives you such an asceticism because um i think that you know all this work should be pulling in everyone you need the philosophers make sure we're asking the right question you need the you know crazy math people like me to come up with like well i don't know let's try like an infinity category and then you need um you know you need active like we need people actually uh you know working on how do you relate all this so you need active influence you need the philosophy and you need to put everyone together yeah so in the dark room my question is it's like um you know at what point was dark like light you know so i think also the darkness is like maybe a pro finite condition the question is if we sat in the dark room forever would it eventually become light you know and then you bring in time so dark room is really interesting and try to think of dark room in a temporal non-locality that's how i would take that problem and kind of accelerate it just a little bit dark room in terms of a diamond dark room inter change the time interpretation like in all these uh models you know time is always uh modeled as a total order that's another thing i would like to hear from your community like um you know total order has this like connectivity property that every two objects in the total order are comparable why why do we model time as continuous why do you model time as a total order um i think that i think that should be changed just a little bit and move it like non-arch medium quantum mechanics is going to work non-ar-comedian with a very specific cut off right the plank length then i think you should also be working with non-archimedean time so um the awesome person who asked the question about the dark room please try to think about dark room like in in some kind of temporal non-locality if time was everywhere i'm really interested in that i'll make one more one more comment here quite early you mentioned how a stack you said it's it it takes in categories not for example sets and connecting that to what you said about operations this might be quite familiar to a computer scientist for whom the function can take in different things so we know there's functions that take in numbers like two plus two but then there might be a function that takes in a large data set that has a diamond description and so computer science and engineering kind of the application it's really easy sometimes to apply these recursive definitions recursion central to computer science but you're right when you go to the infinite level that's kind of where the theory builds beyond any real implementation of a computer program so we're on the bottom looking up with the computer science implementations of nested networks and then here's the hand coming from the top down saying there's a way to you know infinitely structure that and throw a sheath on it or i don't know oh see that's what i'm saying yeah it's like to upgrade a machine learning that's another project i'm working on it's like categorify it you know what i mean like um when you know the specific definition of stack is a two sheaf right so it's a sheath that takes values and categories that's actually and so it's like yeah if you move from you know like an output is a weighted function or something if you move from that to the category of all possible weighted functions then you know your complexity has just grown probably like threefold you see the output no longer needs to be something singular i outputted a weighted function you know particular to this distribution why why don't you output an actual category yeah here's a another great question from the chat from stephen he wrote if these category theory and geometry approaches enable another multi-scale formalism that treats time differently can this approach play nicely with current multi-scale active inference formalisms sounds like he summarized our conversation stephen should present yeah can he tell me a little bit more about the multi-scale active embassy he you're right on it if you stackify things right think of it like this think that um you know like daniel was saying if every you know if every like think of every network being like a point in the modulized space do you see then that whole thing is just a point and then how do you actually get from point to point so is that the sort of like multi-scale multi-class i'm super into like multi-class classification you know i really like this question yes switch it up to like pro finite if you categorify the thing you're going to get more connections right then you're then you're working in like categories of multi-class active inference not just one why don't we split it up why don't you color it call them incarnations and relate them if it's a powerful enough category you can put a sheaf on it put a sheaf on it and then start gluing them all together and then i think you really have a multi-class shared inference does that make sense wow what a great question do you have any thoughts on that on the multi-class i mean i think that's what you know we're saying one thought and the way that we've been talking about multi-scale active inference is like let's say the brain is the internal state and the body is external to it so then you have the blood-brain barrier and then at the next level out you have the brain in the body interacting with the social niche and then you can go up and you can have societies or groups that are interacting with each other and it's a debate in active efforts does the group really have a blanket or what kind of blanket does it have and here we're not gonna speak directly to that but we can think of quote american society as a point it's a point and then it has internal structure but by using that basically linguistic token by saying it is a point it's literally one term that you can pass then it abstracts over lower levels and i'm not exactly sure on um what is strong enough to have a sheath or not or what that enables but it sounds like it's making these nested structures and uh laterally interacting structures making them composable and kind of compilable so that we can tractably zoom in and zoom out or work with guarantees or proofs on these types of structures oh i love that yeah and so i encourage everyone to uh maybe as a challenge and stephen will like this too when we say like okay so thank you for explaining that for the multi-class yeah i agree super like all these levels yeah to reinterpret that because it's always a boundary condition right blood brain barrier vary between me and group vary between like uh collectivity and non-collectivity things like this right um what is a group group action and things like this so reinterpret that with a notion of a pro finite boundary i'm very curious as to what these boundaries are right they're not solid they seem to be sort of like uh are they hidden so the very concept of a boundary is a hidden state is something that i was playing with and i was like you know what at what point is the boundary there does that make sense it's almost like um you know boundary and hidden state is like this dark room phenomena that all of a sudden somebody turns on a light boom boundary is there right so when you have levin and fields talking about like entanglement like uh you know across uh boundaries and things like this like or maybe the only way to deco here is on the boundary where is the information and that's actually a really important question but if you can reframe all of that try to reframe the multi-class like uh you know the multi-scale active inference in terms of a boundary that's like a fractal that's very strange you see what i mean daniel right then it's like then there's no clear defined boundary um i'm sure there's if there's a lot of people listening like anyone kind of super empath or if you have impact friends i mean i swear like some i can just be walking and like you know the tree goes into me or something like that so i don't have very good boundaries like that right my mind thinks about everything and it swaps you know like i wish there was like a jedi school you know i mean i would totally be there like how do i do this um and i think the active inference people like are the jedi school it's like okay let's figure this out so if you do multi-scale any of this play with that notion of a boundary you know just like you saw i'm very you know math people can almost get kind of you know too much with it but you want to be precise about every word and we're real careful when we define things like modulized space like what a family of bundles means what a family of isomorphism classes mean so really think about what you're defining as boundary and if that boundary was not solid because they never are if you have a pro-finite boundary it just changes a little thing it changes the way in which that scale is sort of hierarchized i think yeah do you have multiple levels of inference going on oh my god yeah if i can give a physical metaphor to what you said about these i'm going to schedule yes so let's just say that you were looking at a textbook for anatomy and it would say what is the boundary of the lungs what is the blanket around the lungs well at that level the gross anatomy level it's the peripleura it's the the membrane that just encloses it like one bag and you can even have a point just the lungs but then if you really zoom in it's actually truly a fractal with the alveoli and the way that actually the boundary of the lung it probably looks like a piece of broccoli because are you looking at it from the outside with just a single sack or will you go into finer scale and see that the interface has a fractal dimension oh see and that's what i'm saying right like you know at what point was the room dark was it always dark and we just didn't notice it that's what i'm talking about and will the room always be dark i don't think so right i think at some point if you were in the dark room would change and so just like what daniel is saying you zoom in on this stuff and you know there's more space between the like atoms if you actually want to use that approach right what is that and that's what i'm really interested in so you have all these different smears it could be happening that like if all of these events actually happen and they are just temporarily extended what does that actually mean it's almost like a time sheath you know what i mean if interaction is like this what time spread no idea no idea these are i think these these interrogatories should direct all of the work and that's why all my math is like super philosophy like philosophically i don't know i did say elephants earlier now i just said it phillips so it's like uh okay i'm just getting excited this is awesome um yeah one more on the philosophy um point wait the dark the dark room problem so you just rephrase the dark room problem as being like no was it room always dark it's almost like well if there's no person in the room what's the problem or it's it's thinking about the person's the time that they're in that room because you're not appealing to an alternate universe where somebody has always been and always will be in a dark room you're appealing to our everyday experience of being in a dark room but that is only part of our regular behavioral sequences so not exactly sure where that would uh take the the dark room investigation but it it helps us see that it's part of a bigger set of experiences or of uh of scenarios that the agent is experiencing yeah and my question is like if this boundary is like pro finite and fractal what's what's to prevent us going from dark room and then maybe a white room right dark room white room dark room white room dark room white room right or let me ask if anyone knows what would be the actual um antipodal reference of a dark room is there an actual opposite of a dark room would that be like what would that be if it were interesting if it were a stochastic signal coming into your eyes so just like a white noise then it would almost be like a dark room of a different kind because sure there'd be light coming on your retina but informationally you're still not getting anything so at the higher level it's a similar problem but it it uncouples it from the photons hitting your retina which actually doesn't matter right yeah and i think there was something i was reading um um i forgot what it was about like synesthetes and how cinnace store information because i have sort of half of that um but i was like maybe i should find out a little about myself anyway um there was some wild study that was like if you put pure white light on the retina i would love for your community to investigate this like you actually can't see it actually negates object vision pure white light so unspectraed on the retina well actually negate object vision now again i saw this it was in a philosophy work which i you know i trust the you know again i'm i'm not like a super scientist about that but that's really interesting right so just like daniel said in a pure white room you'd also be in the dark so that's that's interesting and so you see you need this like messy so pure white light you know would hurt us you cannot see object vision so it makes me think is object vision itself pro finite right if it seems to be emergent if it seems to be falling out if you cannot see the actual when pure white light if it's a non-spectra is interacting with our system we cannot take it what are the actual implications of that and can you actually scale that right so that's why i was saying with the dark and and with emergence like at what point it is emergent at what point of like you know photonic light hitting your eyes um must it be non-white like pure you know so that's actually interesting that the actual purest conditions of something may may negate the uh the organism's object functionality right and then we're actually hurting so at that point you may have to rely on the higher two morphisms and then you go join the shannon daniel jedi school i'm just like so uh um maybe i should talk just a little bit more about the time stuff and then um leave with like another fun drawing um this is an awesome conversation um okay so again we all know that time is a problem why is an emergent why am i talking about emergent time when when we can go so far with these ideas it's good to bring in an example like daniel was saying about you know alveoli and things like that um the actual um i take care of a lot of elderly family members and so i my earliest memories are hospitals and that might be why i kind of grew up so quick um just with all these like heavy questions and i remember um you know we were having a lot of problems with like the actual oxygen co2 exchange right that's actually really tricky so it's it's not like if someone you know is uh suffering you know in the like the pulmonary sense you can't just you know and put an oxygen mask on and it's fine so the actual body's way of absorbing that i think is very very very tricky the co2 um you know exchanging with the o2 in this fractal web of broccoli you know so what is that and that's happening 24 7 as i like giggle and give this talk it's like my alveoli are excited i think i just said alveoli like ravioli am i ravioli you're excited all right anyway i don't know what i'm saying all right so um but it's nice to when you have all this high math too try to reign it in with something biological so people like shannon why are you talking about biology like because i want to try to find something here that we can use to sort of justify temporal non-locality besides entangled photon pairs everybody uses entangled photon pairs why don't we use like daniel was saying like the actual system why don't we use the organism to test on um so again if if there's actual entanglement going on in the daughter cells i am excited about that i want to think uh want to ask the community what we think about uh entanglement which is again going to mess with this idea of time right time and boundaries so we know that there's a problem of time um you're like you know your heavy weights and quantum mechanics have the wheeler dewitt equation says the universe is static to an external observer i'm gonna have some questions with like the external versus the internal observer i don't know what that is because again i think all boundaries are pro finite so it's a little tricky um quantum mechanics is you know going to say that time is universal and absolute general relativity is going to say that it's actually malleable and relative right and then you know people like me the category theory of people maybe time is like a morphism you know so i oh wait you know i asked back to the dark room question things like this even your local time was it like what is time was it always here where is not our comedian time so if we're thinking about like hidden states right and any kind of embodied cognition it's very interesting how your memory it's not very solid what peop maybe people's earliest memories like when they're six my one friend he's like uh i don't know like 12 i'm like you don't remember anything until you're 12. like what is that so when does your little system actually come online is this once again a play between irreversibility and reconstructability is it also a play between your multi-scale own active inference have you stopped is it possible that you were only in your own reflections until age seven and then you were able to actually reach your reflections right is this like people's earliest numbers so if you're thinking about like i am that interaction and perception and all these things that are feedback loops with your own system right anything that's feed feeding back into the actual kind of non-local organism for cognition it's reflection based so but if you were only in reflection land maybe your memory would never come online so where is it like where is time was it always here where's yesterday like i just don't know you know um so we say these like you know we have these existential qualifiers like there exists right but what are the conditions for all of this it's you know we're here for such a short time and there's all these big questions right i want to know what an emergent time asymmetry is it's very interesting when i ask you know why do we seem to go forward or something you you're almost you're dealt with another answer that's super fuzzy and only defined in the negative right uh there seems to be like a time asymmetry and like did you just use time to define time like isn't that we can't do that right um i mean i guess we can but what would actually be an emergent time asymmetry at what point if you think about that pro construction i was talking about how do you actually get a time asymmetry and that crazy environment right or just like um you know the beautiful dark room example um or even steven's example the question right how do you actually get asymmetries on this emergent scale go even weirder with what i said how do you get asymmetries in this doubly emergent scale can you actually get an asymmetry in just one of the morphisms i don't know these questions are once again huge how would you actually have the notion of an entropy right in an embodied cognition where you're you know exchanging with the environment if time was discrete this is what i want to think about so just like daniel gave us a great example on the outside we're all so beautiful we wear these like awesome clothes and we have these you know beautiful features and if you actually zoom in like to the actual lung sacs right very tricky fractal stuff going on there why don't we look at time the same way out here you have this you know like supposed continuum which i don't really like believe in what if you zoomed in how would you actually figure if time was actually discrete like a set of points like that modulized space is there a dark room in between each time and that's why i'm really interested in this dark room who's to say that you're not blinking in and out of it like every plank second you know that's what i'm really interested in is that you know your eye seems to be doing an interpolation anyway right they've done those studies about like eye tracking and when you're actually looking at someone it's just like eyes and mouth or something like this you don't really look at the ear so it's actually you're putting together an image of me based on your tracking yeah and so you're actually doing an interpolation like 24 7 even go down to like the cesium atom like time so are you not doing the same thing for time itself that's where i'm really that's what i'm interested in take the time zoom in if time is also this boundary this fractal curve um you know my awesome mentor uh beautiful amazing wizard mentor dr lapidus michelle lapidus you know came up with like you know fractal curves and fractal chromology and all this stuff that's really interesting right fractals data functions um what if time is something like that so what is structural causality you've got bertrand russell and these great wizards right wittgenstein language is a you know a game and um you know uh you know bertrand russell saying you know there's no there's no structural relation between uh now and actually assuming that the world was created you know five minutes ago so there's last thursday as and then you get these fun things all right once again what is object persistence how do you actually do that who's to say that the dark room is not flickering in and out like every you know second and once again the stop mechanism really interested in what your community thinks about that right so again uh in something like you know horribly sad like the proliferation of cancer cells or something why how does that act so locally right you could just have that in a particular area and it starts like spraying through like you know metastasis and stuff like that but it originates locally it doesn't originate as a systemic thing and that's what i'm very interested in seems to be these pockets right pockets of the stop mechanism failing can destroy the whole organism which is back to that torsion thing i was talking about you can have these few elements that annihilate um you know these torsion elements that are annihilated right at the expense of the actual organism so if we actually say how does causality actually change for your per your turing degree remember i sort of think that we can you know in your multi-scale active imprints it would be nice to classify organisms maybe based on their problem-solving um capability um so i really think there are no optic boundaries it seems to be these pro-finite boundaries then you're going to ask ontake boundaries of what ontake boundaries of the organism which you zoom in and find that it's like lung sac like fractal broccoli you know and then you know just to keep going why is space-time only a manifold i showed you these other structures what if we reinterpreted any of that gr stuff is like space-time being a diamond you'd be allowing the multiplicity which is the power of the organism right you are it is not top-down you are learning from everything right so what would actually like a number theoretic time look like um so let's go just a little bit deeper into emergence right assuming it's emergent what is an emergent from what is the actual eschatology of time that's what i'm really interested in like is it going to be here what if it just left you know what if time just walked off and left okay um i'm really interested in planarium so chris fields has taught me a lot about the planarium so these are the the little worms that if you actually cut off a piece of that again i'm not into like animal cruelty but if somehow a piece of them gets like removed that little piece can regenerate the whole organism and so daniel was going to ask like do y'all have any any thoughts um about that because it seems to be that the nervous system is acting non-locally and it seems like or the planarium like can they is that like an emergence like what is that you know so how can you actually have a piece reproduce the whole organism when we can't do that so is there any thoughts about that like we lose a finger and it's very sad we have a stop mechanism that actually prevents that so i was going to just ask you all since you're also complexity theorists right do you also think that because our organism is more complex we have a stronger mark of irreversibility stronger cut off of reconstructability my like if we all lost an arm our arm is not reconstructable given our system but it is for a planaria so is there a play between complexity theory hidden do we have more hidden states than the actual planaria just one of y'all's thoughts on that awesome question i'm going to address it with an empirical observation rather than an appeal to theory and just as you said if we lose part of our body we can't grow back but maybe you know future technology could change that but if you go to an ant colony and you scoop up the ants from a certain location a few minutes later other nest mates will have functionally replaced the nest mates that you had taken because they're all diffusing around in the space and so it's almost like the ant colony is more resilient to perturbation including extreme perturbations however it has less morphological complexity in the interactions than for example a synapse so it's like if you want to have you know the library with a lot of books it's going to take a lot of space if you want to have a really precisely specified topology of interactions like neurons do you're going to have limited not zero but limited flexibility relative to a sort of distributed totally fluidly mixing system like an ant colony so there's definitely something there with a trade-off on the complexity frontier of how much resilience do you have an ability to regenerate or maybe even to perpetuate indefinitely like a sponge or a coral or something like that versus irreversibly move towards order which comes with the cost of uh building tall buildings that can fall down right right and would we rather have like our sugar cubes as an ant colony or the tall building i don't know right am i weird there would be able to do both in awareness we could be ants you know just play um wow that's that's very remarkable so that example is just as profound as these questions that i'm asking right there seems to be so many things happening at once and thinking about it in terms of perturbation which again i linked perturbation to the diamonds as well right you can you can still do that and again so that's a excellent question um and um with like a more excellent answer right like how do you actually talk about emergence and also emergence and perturbation right those go hand in hand but also emergence and irreversibility and just like you said a complexity so thinking about complexity in terms of um you know emergence and also uh i like how you said resistance but you know with the advent of stuff like you know epigenetics and things like that i'm wondering um i don't know if you put plenaria in a very horrible environment if they still continue it seems like ants kind of continue right they're like little fighters um yeah and again who's to say i don't want to be speciesist who's to say that you know we are more complex than the ants because they have a collective phenomena which is like super profound right yeah and so it's like are we building tall buildings to the extent of like not really connecting with each other right you need to think about stuff like that um okay so that's a question yes okay okay just uh cb has returned with some funny and interesting questions so there's two questions there's a tiny one and then uh a big one the tiny one go for it no pun intended is can you elaborate on the idea of the infinitesimal thickening so what does that mean what is your infinitesimal thickening yeah sure say you had a space right i have a space or i have a pen this is my pen so we would actually say that the pin is carved out and it has a specific boundary right um outside of the pin we would say is like a measure zero there's nothing else outside of the pin the pin stops and then you have like space no pen do we all agree there's a very strict boundary line between pin and no pin so in infinitesimals these are these are um in the they're like um collections of infinitely small small pieces they're not identically zero they are they still they exist but they're almost zero but they're not quite zero so surrounding the pin we could say is an infinitesimal thickness which is not all the way to zero but there is like a little bit of wiggle does that make sense so that's what we're saying that there is a wiggle a space around spaces so just like i was saying um it gets you know it gets rid of notions like um singular points so we know there's there was a lot of problems and you know uh part the standard model is great but in particle physics there was problems with having points interact in these finemen diagrams remember everyone and so you actually made the point a one a one dimensional object called a string to avoid the complications of just having a point so in math you can do the same way instead of having a singular condition like this is my now there's problems with that what if you actually had a now that had a little infinitesimal so surrounded by not almost zero so think about the smallest numbers possible but they go infinitely right so this is almost like um if we know that you know the archimedean property that you can always make a bigger number you can always make a smaller number always so imagine that that that negative our comedian all the way down and so you surround a space with those and then you don't have a singular space anymore thank you for the answer and the second question from cambridge breaths was also is it accurate to say that every experienced now can reflect innumerable other nows if so is time travel possible oh see i love your community you know well you know i'm going to say yes because i'm like the magic person here yeah so again what is a now it's very interesting you can have all the elaborate physics on the planet and then you ask what is an observer and the room goes quiet right so when we say what is a now that's what i'm saying like and now according to whom we're all connected right now um i shouldn't say now but at the same time you're peripherally aware of everything going outside like my animals your next appointment your digestive system your autonomic nervous system so when we say now it's like now according to whom are you neglecting your own hidden states and that's why very curious as to what we mean by now also i'm very you know i'm very adamant about saying um you know there is no synchronous reference anyone who thinks this now is actually happening now you've neglected the neuronal processes that are actually happening there's neurotransmitter signals you know everything happen happening on neurological time to actually get you to have this now so you're always in the past does that make sense right you're always in the past uh but you're also not in the past so you can get very like alan watts and eggheart toll here and say you really only have now it is a hallucination to think that there is like a tomorrow because even when you actually remember the past you're doing it now we all agree you're always in this slice right but if you there's a little bit more do you see that if you do a formal spectra with the now if you put a little bit of thickness on it it allows for you to actually have a little bit of more room in the now which is just like what um you know the question is asking can you you know the now actually contains other nouns yeah because um if the whole if time is this pro construction which is what i'm trying to say then you are linking together all kinds of things right your thoughts happening now where are they coming from i don't know and so is time travel possible oh yeah you bet that's what i said that's why i was saying look at me i'm all excited you know if you can actually partition the brain okay so let's get weird i mean not too weird don't do this to yourself like right now hold on um if you were actually to make the brain so that it was almost like a split screen this is a very rough analogy if you remember those like i don't know older films that had like one panel going and the other one i loved those just because you know i think like synthetic hyperactive i need to be like doing a lot like multitask so imagine you had that kind of split screen but in your own awareness in the awareness not the now but if we were actually able to split the system then you would actually be able to quote time travel if time is non-local and if it was always there all you really have to do is try to get to your like your your own v stack and i think people are really what is this girl talking about but it's like if you could actually get to where you had those hieromorphisms then that would be very very exciting and then time travel should be possible when people time travel it's like they normally they normally like them the object themselves doesn't travel and they seem to think that you know perturbation doesn't exist so it's like if you're going to time travel you're going to be perturbing time be ready for time to perturb you back i'm not saying it will be like a very gentle experience but i am completely all for it there seems to be something in the system that keeps us on one channel and i you know i just to ask the community those are great questions and even ask the question you know the if the question i want to ask again what is their own thoughts about why do you seem to be in this one channel everyone will say well because there's a time there's a time asymmetry and the past is irreversible well we've seen how shady irreversibility is right it's a boundary phenomenon and so you almost have to be like somebody called me miss frizzle once like the magic school bus lady i was like okay this is great and she's got like red hair and she's driving this school bus going into these things i would totally take a school bus and go into the alveoli like what is this place if you were to actually drive the school bus into the actual boundary you're gonna see it's not there i mean it is because you can hear me like hitting the table it is to on this channel but if we were actually like able to access the multi-channels you know i'm not sure is time travel possible yeah you're going to have to partition awareness not partition the brain because you would be very sick and i don't want to lose you um you cannot you know but try to think of why this whole interface and why in body cognition is here for one channel like can we actually have a multi and that's what i was saying can we actually have like a three embodied cognition you know what do you think about time travel dan or any of that sorry if that was too wild everyone but i'm getting excited you know good question um i have i've heard a few different ways it could happen yeah and i uh would love to see evidence it could yeah evidence it could and that's why you know you can look to um so you know as free as i am in the math space and i'm open and i want to travel because i want you know humans to like succeed and you know uh yeah i want or i want organic life to continue i'm very worried about that so whatever we can do let's let's try to keep it going um and then uh you know something to help the questioner also is like this great work it'll be coming out soon by lebanon fields about you know um decoherence is actually localized to intercompartmental boundaries right where is it not okay so if the internal bulk states of daughter cells may remain entangled for macroscopic times following cell division so you have little pockets of time travel right if you have entanglement and so there is like hope if there is entanglement in the biological setting um again most people may think their work is like you know to future thinking or whatever but i'm super future thinking let's try to figure this out you know um lots of ramifications you know this theory of extended mind this philosophy theory i thought was actually like really great andy clark right um you know if you're operating through time as these series of dots you're going to have something called a singular support you've got i i'm really curious how you remember a memory right so again if the whole point of shared action is to get these morphisms between morphisms um you know when the questions are asked is it possible that your now is a you know like a collection of other nouns well absolutely you're probably operating in a nested space right about like a a perturbative pro-finite um memory of a memory right so you start having these meta memories memory of memory and it's very interesting you're like oh i know what a cat looks like and then i see it again that is my cat it's very interesting how you link that so something as simple as object persistence right is actually everywhere time is not a total order right um and how do you actually relate all this stuff um great i i should probably go in about like five minutes because i have a class but i wanted to actually show oh i have unicorns everywhere right so there's magic i'm like how would you so the another main takeaway for the math take away the diamonds and the sheaths and all the stuff is also the notion of a reciprocity law these are really beautiful reciprocity laws connect seemingly different branches of mathematics so like in the lang lens program connecting uh these certain galwa representations which is one branch of math with automorphic forms which is like you know harmonic analysis like that is beauty right that's actually kind of synesthetic at a certain point and i think since i am kind of like synesthetic but i align with these sort of grand unified theories i'm like oh that feels like home like that feels right to be siloed like doesn't feel right still be individual but also be able to uh connect in these like reciprocity laws so how would you actually have a reciprocity law of emergent time that actually means you're able to link emergent time with newtonian time string theory time alveoli time the time of c of co2 and o2 exchange right how do you actually how do you actually relate all those times quantum time everybody's time no time dark room time uh the time before existence that kind of like long like christ consciousness time all the times right that's huge and that's why i said well i don't know i put a big unicorn on there because it's gonna be some magic so it'll take some magic to actually get a lot of time but you've got great heavy weights trying to work on that um you know uh like emergent theories of time or like tricky and they're hard you know so if you have this like new reciprocity law if you actually could connect the diamonds and like you know i'm really everyone knows and um i'm really interested in like the mirror framework if mirror phenomena are actually how you're interacting so when people say well what is the now is it just your mirror system imitation and daniel i wanted to ask your community and you what is your interpretation of like if you believe in mirror neurons or the actual mirror system that learns by imitation because that's very very powerful right we were talking about stuff like that so um just wanted your thoughts on the mirror framework and uh the mirror framework in terms of like these hidden states as well it's a great question i'd be curious to know what a different hypotheses the mirror neuron helps us get at what different observations in the world we could actually test for example does somebody who's not looking but they're feeling someone else move maybe does that i'm just curious about it don't have the answers although in general i'd say adding an adjective like oh it's the jennifer aniston neuron it's the mirror neuron it's like okay but that's a reductionist take because it's labeling the neuron so if it turns out that we have a dynamic distributed function in our brain that does have action models of ourself as well as action models of others and maybe there are some firing patterns that are overlapping but there's probably some action patterns only if you're watching someone else and only if you're moving or every other combination so i just think it's one of the facets of the brain diamonds and it's not um the whole picture i like that yeah seeing once again right even like even having this very strange like little piece that's this mirror thing i just know i was watching um uh someone um you know like another heavyweight give this talk about this and the sort of the phantom limb syndrome and stuff like that right if your limb is lost and someone else is maybe like you know touching the same limb that you lost you sort of feel that and there's like and these people aren't even kind of empath like like me you know they're not like me coming up and stuff like this they're like you know less hyperbolic i would say but um they so uh it was interesting the neurologist i was actually happy to hear him kind of go do a shared action kind of thing said uh you know it seems that the only thing that separates us is the skin because if i can feel what you can feel you can feel what i can feel everything is imitation then it seems to be like this skin boundary and then again boundaries are pro finite not ontic right so you know that had me perplexed so i appreciate your answer there yeah um okay i think i've already talked about most of this the topological localization so when i said you know you can put a you know a topology i said you could put a sheath on a category well everyone should also think how you actually could put a topology on an infinite one category so i'm working on something like that that's actually really tricky you have to figure out what the open sets are in an infinite category with infinite morphisms you know so this sort of condensed framework that i was talking about um i'll wrap up with this so you have this notion i said the condensed framework was a sheaf over a point so if we talk about a site so remember i told you the site is a place where you can actually put a topology so we called um peter and dustin call this the pro-tell site of a point is the category of pro finite sets s with finite jointly subjective families of maps as covers a condensed set it's a sheaf of sets on this site so on this site right so it's a sheath of sets over a point but on the point is the category of pro finite sets so you already have that kind of multi scale in this sort of point so you do have sheaves over a point but the point has the site of profinite sets so you can do this to condensed ring if this this is all about trying to do the same algebra mathematics you've always done but when your objects actually carry a topology that's what's interesting all the objects so reframe everything like the six tuple and active friends inference put a topology on it have all of your algebraic things modules groups rings carry topology how do you do stuff with that um okay so that's fine that's fine the way that you can associate this you take t to be any topological space to t there was an associated condensed set t underline you saw the underline and the spot of qp the spa qp sub atomic mod uh galwa action with the underline that i showed you earlier um this is defined by sending any pro finite s to the set of continuous maps from s to t so that's what you're trying that's how you can associate to any topological space a condensed set so how beautiful is that so you can reframe if you have stuff in terms of topology we can bulldoze it i shouldn't say bulldoze that's a little extreme reframe it in terms of these condensed if you want to get this very interesting sort of sheaf over a point and then you can do like the weird thing that i was saying put a formal formal spectre around it to make it a little like a little thicker um okay so to actually consider this emergent time what i what i said let's consider the simplest case an event um you know which is like a truncated perturbation something like that a topological localization of any particular reference frame so that means i'm in the now i am staring at my reflections whatever that is um let's take an event to be a point in the diamond topological space t we're gonna actually convert this to a condensed set on that point is the pro it tells site uh the category for finite set so here we go this global time maybe emerges as a set of continuous maps from all pro finite sets s to t because i said the individual time is diamond which is pro finite so if time if global time is constructed as the sheaf of sets on this site as a condensed set right then emergent time is going to result in passing to the larger category of sheaves right so we just keep talking about sheaves on categories let's talk about like the larger cat let's just frame it all in the category of sheaves and you can consider a condensed version of this continuous k theory this is so hard um and it'll take me a bit to finish it but as soon as i make little progress i get excited a second way to get emergent time is to take those like if if if condensed time is local time let's take you know uh equivalence relations of those to get your multi-scale active inference again and you can actually take diamond equivalence relations to get the v stacks and already went over that so i made up i came up with this like dictionary between ordinary quantum mechanics and perfectoid quantum mechanics upgrade the hilbert space which is a sort of like you know complete inner product space let's make it a perfectoid space right the sort of strange uh fractal space replace you know state vectors with the geometric points the tensor product with the diamond product the non-locality phenomena maybe it's the profinitely many copies of spa c if you have that many reflections uh you don't know which one is the reference point you can uh the wave function collapses this tilting the coupling behavior right holographic principle uh quantum topology replace it with the satellite of diamonds take your operator algebra replace it with a non-ethereum complete evaluation ring um uh unitarity pro telescent datum or that diamond descent that's great okay so i will end there and say thank you so you know i'm into everyone working together and you see there's draft elephant baby unicorn unicorns everyone is working together here and there's some like zero sharp on the board and the spot of qp diamond i should stop there yeah and take other questions yeah we'll let you head off to your class in just a minute but this was very thought-provoking and interesting so i hope that um people will ask you questions in the meanwhile and then uh i'm sure there'll be more math streams in our future that's wonderful and then um does everyone have my email or guess they do on the um yeah i mean i'm yeah anyone can always get in touch with actonflab to contact a guest or if you send us a link that you want us to put in the video description then we'll add that there but i think we're all going to uh go home go back hit the books and uh i really enjoyed doing it live oh youtube this was so fun and i think like maybe the next talk would be like uh it'd be fun to do these thought experiments right like what if what if the question of dark room and how we use active inference and this map to get out of it you know i'd i'd uh suggest a event format where we have multiple different backgrounds and perspectives and then we give people the prompts and the thought questions and then we do have a spontaneous conversation about how different perspectives lead to different views on the thought questions oh that sounds so great okay yes well thank you so whoever wants to join whoever wants to join you're always welcome so thank you again and we'll see you later thank you so much
