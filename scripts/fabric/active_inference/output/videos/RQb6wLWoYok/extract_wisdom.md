- The role of boundaries in cognition can be understood through a pro finite lens, emphasizing fluidity.
- Understanding simultaneity requires rethinking traditional notions of time and space in mathematics.
- The relationship between cognition and non-locality can redefine our understanding of consciousness.
- Time travel becomes a metaphor for exploring the intersection of different temporalities and experiences.
- The concept of shared action underlines the importance of collective cognition in understanding time.
- Each moment or "now" reflects innumerable other moments, inviting exploration of memory and perception.
- The intersection of mathematics and biology reveals new insights into the nature of consciousness and existence.
- The complexity of systems like ant colonies versus human cognition highlights differences in resilience and adaptability.
- The brain's ability to process multiple channels of information challenges traditional models of consciousness.

- Boundaries in cognition are not fixed but can be fluid and multi-dimensional, challenging traditional views.
- Understanding simultaneity requires embracing non-linear and non-local perspectives on time and reality.
- The relationship between cognition and non-locality may redefine how we perceive consciousness and experience.
- Emergent phenomena in mathematics and biology suggest a shared framework for understanding complex systems.
- Collective cognition through shared action emphasizes the interconnectedness of individual experiences and knowledge.
- The concept of time travel invites exploration into the fluidity of moments and their interrelations.
- Memory and perception are deeply entwined with the construction of identity and self-awareness.
- The complexity of systems like ant colonies offers insights into resilience and adaptability in cognitive processes.
- Rethinking the nature of time and its properties may unveil new dimensions of understanding in various fields.

# QUOTES:
- "The goal is to take the holographic principle and reinterpret it in terms of continuous k theory."
- "Emergent time is not just one but many, existing simultaneously in different forms."
- "To rephrase the holographic principle, we should upgrade our understanding of time."
- "The beauty of duality is that if one space is too hard, you go to the other space."
- "How does active inference see these time streams like are there local times around them?"
- "What does embodied cognition in non-locality mean?"
- "If you take the diamond and glue it together, you can build something larger."
- "The distinction between simultaneity and non-locality is a philosophical challenge."
- "We must consider the notion of a boundary in cognition as pro finite, not ontic."
- "If time is everywhere, how do we understand its multiplicities?"
- "Memory may only be accessible through the reflections of our experiences."
- "The actual point of view of time is a continuous mapping of pro finite sets."
- "Can we model thoughts as pro-finite reflections of topological covers oriented in non-locality?"
- "What if we could access our memories through a multi-channel perspective?"
- "Cognition is a reflection of the environment, and we must understand it as such."
- "The essence of shared action is understanding the relations between different nows."
