# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Maxwell and Dalton discuss their recent paper on rebooting free energy principle literature, exploring its mathematical foundations and implications.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The free energy principle (FEP) has evolved significantly since its inception around 2005.
2. Previous literature on FEP lacked comprehensive surveys post-2019, prompting the authors' paper.
3. FEP describes self-organizing systems following paths of least surprisal through probabilistic approaches.
4. Active inference is related to FEP, involving autonomous states and decision processes.
5. The authors identify three main formulations of FEP in current literature: state density, path density, and mode tracking.
6. Bayesian mechanics connects FEP to classical mechanics, emphasizing a duality between entropy principles.
7. Gauge theory provides a geometric framework to understand the relationships within Bayesian mechanics.
8. The Helmholtz decomposition and its relation to FEP reveal deeper insights into dynamical systems.
9. The authors advocate for a spectrum of cognition, rejecting dualism between living and non-living systems.
10. G theory aims to extend FEP to account for non-stationary systems and complex dynamics.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. FEP integrates physics and cognitive sciences to describe self-organizing systems.
2. Mathematical prerequisites are essential for understanding complex theories in FEP literature.
3. The authors emphasize the importance of distinguishing between dynamics, mechanics, and principles in FEP.
4. G theory represents a promising direction for future research on non-stationary systems.
5. The relationship between agents and their environment is central to understanding cognition and inference.
