# SUMMARY
Mao Abrasion discusses confirmation bias, conformity, and active inference's role in understanding cognitive processes and social behaviors during guest stream 17.1.

# IDEAS:
- Confirmation bias leads individuals to prefer information that aligns with their existing beliefs.
- Humans have evolved to be sensitive to reliable versus unreliable information sources.
- Cognitive dissonance arises when new information conflicts with deeply held beliefs.
- Social groups influence individual beliefs through shared norms and behaviors.
- Echo chambers can form when individuals only engage with like-minded sources.
- Active inference models how agents update beliefs based on sensory information and expectations.
- Habits form through repeated behaviors that become automatic over time.
- Social volatility affects how agents perceive and interact with their environment.
- Agents in a network can influence one another's beliefs and behaviors.
- Higher network connectivity reduces the risk of polarization among beliefs.
- Information spread can be optimized through tools like hashtags in social media.
- Agents prefer to sample information from peers that share their views.
- Exposure to diverse perspectives can help mitigate polarization in communities.
- Individuals with higher tolerance for cognitive dissonance can adapt better to conflicting information.
- The structure of social networks influences the dynamics of belief formation.
- Active inference allows for modeling the cognitive processes of agents in social systems.

# INSIGHTS:
- Confirmation bias can lead to misinformation propagation within tightly-knit communities.
- The need for social belonging can drive individuals to conform to group beliefs.
- Cognitive frameworks shape how individuals interpret their experiences and interactions.
- Active inference provides a mechanism for understanding behavior in uncertain environments.
- Social learning can enhance the resilience of communities facing misinformation.
- Individual beliefs are influenced by both personal experiences and social interactions.
- The quality of information is often judged based on its source rather than its content.
- Cognitive dissonance can be a barrier to accepting new ideas or information.
- Diverse epistemic communities foster richer discussions and understanding of complex issues.
- The relationship between agents is crucial for the dynamic evolution of beliefs.

# HABITS:
- Individuals should seek diverse perspectives to challenge their existing beliefs and reduce bias.
- Engage in regular reflection to identify and address personal cognitive dissonance.
- Foster open dialogue within groups to encourage the exchange of differing viewpoints.
- Use social media mindfully to avoid echo chambers and misinformation traps.
- Develop habits of critical thinking to assess the reliability of information sources.

# FACTS:
- Humans have developed a capacity to discriminate between reliable and unreliable information sources.
- Cognitive dissonance varies in tolerance among individuals, influencing belief adaptability.
- Individuals often prefer information from in-group sources, reinforcing confirmation bias.
- Social networks with higher connectivity tend to reduce belief polarization.
- Information can spread more effectively through social media tools like hashtags.
- Habits can become ingrained through repeated behaviors, shaping future actions.
- Active inference is a framework for understanding cognitive processes in uncertain environments.
- The dynamics of belief formation are influenced by social interactions and network structures.
- Echo chambers can lead to misinformation propagation within communities.
- Exposure to conflicting viewpoints can enhance understanding and reduce polarization.
