# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The active inference live stream discusses the emergence of valence in deep active inference, emphasizing collaborative learning and interactive modeling.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The active inference lab promotes collaborative learning and practice in applied active inference.
2. Participants introduced themselves and shared their backgrounds during the live stream.
3. The discussion focused on the paper "Deeply Felt Affect: The Emergence of Valence in Deep Active Inference."
4. The paper presents a stepwise approach to understanding active inference concepts.
5. Key concepts include hidden states, sensory states, and the importance of prediction and inference.
6. The effective charge represents the relationship between prior and posterior beliefs in active inference.
7. Local interactions are essential for maintaining biological plausibility in active inference models.
8. The models can be extended to explore social dynamics and effective representations.
9. The importance of contextual evidence and how it influences perceptions and actions.
10. Holographic effects in cognition allow organisms to predict and interact with distant states.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference emphasizes collaborative learning and diverse perspectives in scientific inquiry.
2. Understanding complex models requires incremental, stepwise education and engagement.
3. The effective charge is crucial for modeling how beliefs influence actions and perceptions.
4. Local interactions are foundational to maintaining biological relevance in modeling.
5. Exploring social dynamics and contextual influences enriches understanding of active inference applications.
