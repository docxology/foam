# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference Lab's live stream discusses a paper on deep active inference, focusing on affect, prediction, and metacognition.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The session aims to discuss "Deeply Felt Affect" paper by Casper Hesp and colleagues.
2. Participants introduced themselves, sharing their backgrounds and interests in active inference.
3. The paper emphasizes hierarchical models and their implications for deep learning and active inference.
4. Key concepts include hidden states, sensory states, and the role of prediction in active inference.
5. Effective charge is introduced as a key aspect influencing inference and decision-making in systems.
6. The relationship between predictions and inferences is central to understanding active inference dynamics.
7. Effective representation and motivation are explored in the context of decision-making and action selection.
8. The model's structure allows for flexibility in adding new variables while maintaining biological plausibility.
9. Local interactions in models are crucial for preserving the Markov blanket and ensuring biological relevance.
10. The discussion includes the potential implications of the model for understanding social dynamics and emotional states.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference combines prediction and inference to model cognitive processes.
2. The concept of effective charge integrates motivation and emotional states into decision-making.
3. Hierarchical models can capture complex dynamics in cognitive and social contexts.
4. Local interactions within models are essential for maintaining biological realism.
5. Future research can explore the relationship between these models and real-world social behaviors.
