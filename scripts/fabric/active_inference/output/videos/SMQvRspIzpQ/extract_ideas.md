# IDEAS

- The Active Inference Lab aims to communicate, learn, and practice applied active inference.
- Participants can provide feedback to improve the lab's work and practice video etiquette.
- The live stream discusses the paper "Deeply Felt Affect: The Emergence of Valence in Deep Active Inference."
- The paper's authors include Casper Hesp, Ryan Smith, Thomas Parr, Mika Allen, Carl Friston, and Maxwell Ramstead.
- Casper Hesp introduces the concepts from the paper, emphasizing a stepwise approach for understanding active inference.
- Active inference involves hierarchical models and Bayesian methods for inferring hidden and sensory states.
- The presentation includes directed acyclic graphs to illustrate mathematical relationships in active inference.
- Understanding the flow of information in active inference includes predicting future states based on prior knowledge.
- The model emphasizes the distinction between downstream prediction and upstream inference.
- Hidden and sensory states are represented as variables and parameters within the graphs.
- The effective charge in active inference relates to the difference between prior and posterior beliefs.
- Hierarchical models can incorporate various states and allow for dynamic action modeling based on preferences.
- The expected free energy guides actions and influences decision-making processes in active inference.
- The model allows for state-dependent preferences that can change based on situational context.
- Metacognition and reflective capacities can be integrated into the action models of active inference.
- The effective charge can influence perception and action selection, reflecting motivational dynamics.
- Active inference models can explore different types of motivation, such as epistemic curiosity versus reward-driven behavior.
- The integration of social dynamics in active inference can model empathic responses and contagion effects.
- The framework allows for exploring the representation of cognitive processes beyond simple neural correlates.
- The model can accommodate both local interactions and emergent properties in complex systems.
- Holographic principles may apply to how distant interactions are modeled in active inference frameworks.
- The iterative nature of active inference allows for continuous updating of beliefs and representations over time.
- The effective charge serves as a bridge between different levels of inference and cognitive processes.
- Future developments may include simulating learning dynamics and their effects on emotional regulation.
- The code provided in the paper supports reproducibility and further exploration of active inference concepts.
- The model emphasizes the need for flexibility and adaptability in constructing active inference architectures.
- Engaging with qualitative experiences can enhance the understanding and applicability of active inference models.
