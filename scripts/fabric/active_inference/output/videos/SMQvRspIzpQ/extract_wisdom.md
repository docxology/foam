# SUMMARY
Active Inference Lab's livestream discusses "Deeply Felt Affect" paper by Casper Hesp and others, exploring affect, inference, and the dynamics of active inference.

# IDEAS:
- The active inference model integrates hidden and sensory states using directed acyclic graphs.
- Understanding the structure of models is essential for predicting hidden states and sensory perceptions.
- Incremental learning can simplify complex models, making them more accessible to newcomers.
- The model suggests that predictions are informed by both prior beliefs and sensory evidence.
- Bayesian model reduction aids in linking discrete and continuous state spaces effectively.
- Effective charge represents the difference between prior and posterior beliefs about policies.
- Hierarchical models allow for meta-cognitive reflections on predictions and inferences.
- Active inference models can capture emotional responses and contextual influences on behavior.
- Social dynamics can influence individual decision-making through shared affective states.
- Empathy and contagion can be modeled as emergent properties of the active inference framework.
- The local interactions principle maintains biological plausibility within active inference models.
- Dynamic preferences can be integrated into models to enhance understanding of motivation.
- Effective representation in the model does not need to be explicitly defined but can remain implicit.
- The effective charge can inform the perception-action cycle in decision-making processes.
- Emotional imprints can guide interactions with models and influence behavior in meaningful ways.
- The model can simulate learning and developmental processes within agents based on social interactions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Active inference models offer a structured way to understand perception and action dynamics.
- Hierarchical layers within models facilitate complex interactions and emergent cognitive processes.
- Local interactions are crucial for maintaining the biological relevance of active inference frameworks.
- Effective charge can mediate how agents respond to external stimuli based on internal states.
- Incorporating social dimensions into models enhances understanding of group behaviors and dynamics.
- The balance between exploration and exploitation in decision-making can be captured through active inference.
- The model's flexibility allows for the integration of various learning types, including social learning.
- Emotional states can significantly influence cognitive processes and decision-making strategies.
- The iterative nature of learning and inference reflects the complexity of real-world interactions.
- Understanding how models reflect our subjective experiences can aid in developing effective interventions.
