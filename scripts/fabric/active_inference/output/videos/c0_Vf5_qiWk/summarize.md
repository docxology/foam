# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Mark Solms discusses the foundational role of affect in consciousness, emphasizing its physiological and philosophical implications in understanding human experience.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Affect is claimed to be the foundational form of consciousness, intrinsically conscious and vital for human experience.
2. Consciousness is primarily generated by the reticular activating system and periaqueductal gray in the brain.
3. Unconscious emotions are considered an oxymoron; feelings cannot exist without consciousness.
4. Empirical evidence shows that patients with no cortex can still exhibit conscious affective responses.
5. Homeostasis is essential for survival, and affect serves as an extended form of homeostasis, indicating well-being.
6. Complex organisms require multiple categorical homeostats, each with unique qualitative feelings.
7. Prioritization of needs occurs in the periaqueductal gray, determining which affective state qualifies consciousness.
8. Confabulation in patients demonstrates how impaired memory can lead to excessive confidence in incorrect beliefs.
9. Affects modulate precision in cognitive processes, influencing how predictions and actions are adjusted.
10. Understanding affect may provide insights into the hard problem of consciousness, shifting focus from cognitive to affective mechanisms.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Feelings are inherently conscious and cannot exist unconsciously.
2. The brain's reticular activating system is crucial for consciousness and emotional response.
3. Homeostasis and affect are interconnected, guiding organismic survival and decision-making.
4. Affects have distinct qualitative experiences that inform our understanding of consciousness.
5. Investigating affective mechanisms can enhance our grasp of consciousness and its complexities.
