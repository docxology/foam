- Skillful performance transcends mere execution, embodying the intricate interplay of action, knowledge, and context.

- Active inference proposes a dynamic model where actions arise from beliefs, reducing uncertainty in motor behavior.

- Instructionism, while valuable, limits understanding by framing skill solely as knowledge-driven commands.

- Flow states reveal the seamless integration of perception and action, bypassing conscious knowledge to enhance performance.

- The interplay between motor representations and actions highlights the non-linear relationship between thought and execution.

- Knowledge can inhibit skillful performance, as overthinking often disrupts the natural flow of actions.

- Active inference fosters a richer understanding of agency, emphasizing interactions over rigid, instruction-based frameworks.

- The generative model in active inference accommodates diverse behaviors, challenging traditional command-and-control narratives.

- Understanding skilled performance through active inference encourages exploration of embodied cognition beyond cognitive boundaries.

- The paradox of skillful performance illustrates the tension between cognitive awareness and instinctual action.

- Active inference integrates multiple dimensions of cognition, recognizing the importance of context in shaping behavior.

- Rethinking motor control through active inference invites a broader perspective on learning, adaptation, and collaboration.

- The relationship between knowledge and skill is complex, suggesting a need for a more nuanced understanding.

- Identifying as a performer transcends mere instruction-following, encompassing identity shaped by dynamic interactions.

- Future research should explore the implications of active inference on diverse domains of human activity and agency.

- The integration of sensory and motor processes through active inference presents a holistic approach to understanding behavior.
