# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion focuses on the paper "Embodied Skillful Performance," critiquing instructionist models and proposing active inference for understanding motor behavior.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. ActonFlab livestream 23.0 discusses the paper "Embodied Skillful Performance."
2. The goal is to critique instructionist control theoretic models of skillful performance.
3. Active inference is proposed as an alternative framework for understanding motor behavior.
4. Skillful performance involves intelligent bodily activities, not just explicit instructions.
5. The paper distinguishes between strong and weak instructionism in motor representation.
6. Motor representations relate to action-oriented representations in skillful performance.
7. Active inference allows for real-time adaptation to environmental changes.
8. The paradox of skillful performance involves the relationship between action and knowledge.
9. Active inference emphasizes interactions over instructions in skillful performance.
10. The authors argue that generative models do not require explicit knowledge for action.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference offers a more dynamic approach to understanding motor behavior.
2. Knowledge and instructions are not always necessary for skillful performance.
3. Skillful performance can exist in a continuum from unskilled to expert actions.
4. The relationship between action and knowledge is complex and context-dependent.
5. Future research should explore the implications of active inference on skilled performance.
