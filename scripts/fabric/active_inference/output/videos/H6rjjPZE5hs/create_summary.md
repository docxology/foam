# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Actin Lab's livestream discussed extended active inference, cognition, culture, and the dynamics of cognitive offloading and uploading.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The livestream focused on the paper "Extended Active Inference" by Clark, Kirchoff, and Fristen.
2. Participants shared personal insights on cognition, culture, and the implications of extended cognition.
3. The concept of "glue and truth" emphasizes belief in extended cognition's validity.
4. Cultural cognition influences how individuals interact and cue off one another.
5. Extended active inference highlights the role of cognitive niches and ecological psychology.
6. Cognitive offloading differs from cognitive uploading, with distinct implications for knowledge sharing.
7. The discussion included examples from theater, jazz, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
8. The idea of joint self-evidencing illustrates the interconnectedness of cognition among participants.
9. Mechanisms of perception, learning, and action were explored in the context of cognitive processes.
10. The complexities of cognitive interactions challenge simplistic views of individual cognition.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Extended cognition relies on cultural context and belief systems to thrive.
2. Cognitive uploading creates novel functions that can be shared intergenerationally.
3. Action offloading can enhance efficiency and reduce cognitive load in tasks.
4. The interplay of individual and shared cognition is vital for effective collaboration.
5. Understanding cognitive dynamics can improve learning, teaching, and application in various fields.
