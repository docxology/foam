# SUMMARY
In ActinFlab livestream 41.1, participants discuss the paper "Extended Active Inference" by Clark et al., exploring cognitive processes, cultural influence, and shared cognition.

# IDEAS:
- Extended cognition requires belief and access to information for effective functioning in culture.
- Cultural cognition influences how individuals develop cognitive skills and learn in diverse environments.
- Shared cultural experiences enhance cognitive processes, allowing for improvisation and adaptation.
- Different cultures have unique expectations for learning and innovation, affecting perceptions of intelligence.
- The cognitive niche includes psychological, functional, and ecological perspectives that shape cognition.
- Extended active inference integrates cognitive processes beyond individual minds into a shared environment.
- Cognitive uploading creates new functions assimilated by culture, while offloading minimizes individual cognitive burdens.
- The distinction between uploading and offloading reveals implications for learning and cognitive development.
- Collective intelligence can be enhanced through collaborative environments fostering interdisciplinary interactions.
- The dynamic interplay between cognition and culture shapes individual and collective learning experiences.
- The concept of desire lines illustrates how cultural practices can influence behavior and cognition.
- Joint self-evidencing emphasizes the interdependence of cognitive entities in shared environments.
- Cognitive offloading and uploading can be viewed through the lens of cultural evolution and adaptation.
- The relationship between anatomical, mechanical, and functional psychological blankets can inform our understanding of cognition.
- The tension between realism and instrumentalism highlights the complexities of cognitive processes in various contexts.
- Effective cognitive functions can arise from the interaction of multiple nested systems in a shared environment.

# INSIGHTS:
- Culture significantly shapes cognition by providing frameworks for learning, understanding, and interaction.
- Uploading cognitive functions transforms how knowledge is shared and utilized within cultural contexts.
- The interplay of cognitive and cultural processes creates opportunities for innovative problem-solving.
- Understanding cognitive processes requires acknowledging the influence of social and cultural dynamics.
- Effective learning occurs in environments that foster collaboration and mutual understanding among participants.
- The boundaries of cognition are fluid and can shift based on context and interaction.
- Engaging with diverse perspectives enriches cognitive development and promotes adaptability.
- Cognitive offloading can enhance efficiency, but may also lead to dependency on external resources.
- The evolution of cognitive functions reflects the complexities of human interaction and cultural adaptation.
- Joint self-evidencing illustrates how cognitive entities can collaboratively shape their environments.

# QUOTES:
- "In order for you to have extended cognition, you have to believe in it."
- "There is glue and truth in cognition; we are glued to our phones for a reason."
- "Cognition is cultural; it affects how we learn and innovate."
- "The ability to improvise in cultural settings is essential for effective cognition."
- "Active inference plays a crucial role in shaping cognitive processes beyond individual minds."
- "Cognitive uploading is about creating functions that the cognitive niche assimilates."
- "The interplay between culture and cognition can enhance collective intelligence."
- "Cognitive offloading minimizes internal processing costs and increases reliability."
- "Understanding cognition requires acknowledging social and cultural dynamics."
- "The relationship between different kinds of blankets informs our understanding of cognition."
- "Effective learning occurs in environments fostering collaboration and mutual understanding."
- "The boundaries of cognition are fluid and can shift based on context."
- "Engaging with diverse perspectives enriches cognitive development."
- "Cognitive offloading can enhance efficiency but lead to dependency."
- "The evolution of cognitive functions reflects the complexities of human interaction."
- "Joint self-evidencing shows how cognitive entities shape their environments."

# HABITS:
- Regularly reflect on personal cultural influences on cognition and learning experiences.
- Engage in discussions that challenge and expand your understanding of cognitive processes.
- Collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds to foster interdisciplinary learning.
