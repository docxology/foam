# IDEAS

- Actinlab promotes participatory learning and practice of applied active inference through live streams.
- The paper discussed is "Extended Active Inference: Constructing Predictive Cognition Beyond Skulls."
- Extended cognition involves belief and access to cognitive resources, represented by "glue and truth."
- Cultural cognition shapes how individuals interact and learn within their communities.
- Extended cognition can be demonstrated through shared cultural practices, like improvisational theater.
- The interplay between cognition and culture influences how people cue off each other in social contexts.
- Child development reflects different cultural approaches to learning and innovation in problem-solving.
- The cognitive niche consists of psychological, functional, and ecological dimensions that influence cognition.
- Active inference serves as a framework to understand cognitive extensions and their implications.
- Cognitive uploading involves the integration of new cognitive functions into the niche, unlike offloading.
- The evolution of cognition is tied to ecological dynamics and the cultural context of learning.
- The relationship between cognition and the niche can be reciprocal, influencing both parties.
- The distinction between anatomical/mechanical and functional/psychological blankets is critical in understanding cognition.
- Cognitive offloading minimizes internal processing costs by restructuring the world for easier navigation.
- Cognitive uploading allows for the creation of novel functions that become part of the cognitive niche.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration fosters innovation by merging diverse perspectives and knowledge bases.
- Joint action in cognitive environments relies on understanding shared cultural practices and rules.
- Feedback loops in extended cognition systems lead to continuous evolution and adaptation.
- The complexity of cognitive systems increases with nested interactions and multi-scale dynamics.
- Understanding the relationship between different types of cognitive blankets enhances our grasp of cognition.
- Effective learning and application require a balance of both realism and instrumentalist perspectives.
- The partitioning of cognitive functions influences how knowledge is created, shared, and inherited.
- The dynamic nature of cognition emphasizes the importance of context and cultural influences in learning.
- Investigating cognitive processes requires an appreciation for the interplay of various cognitive systems.
