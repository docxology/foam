- Life's essence may not lie solely in minimizing free energy but in adaptive trajectories over time.

- Free energy minimization is necessary for life, yet insufficient, highlighting complexity in biological systems.

- Acknowledging the subjective nature of priors enriches understanding of decision-making in living organisms.

- The relationship between necessity and sufficiency reveals insights into understanding life’s adaptive nature.

- Contextual factors influence the effectiveness of priors, altering the perception of life and non-life.

- Adaptive priors reflect a species’ fitness to its environment, shaping evolutionary success over time.

- Distinctions between living and non-living systems blur, complicating definitions of life in biological discourse.

- Active inference broadens understanding beyond mere existence, embracing the dynamics of decision-making processes.

- Life's integrity relies on a balance between adaptive behavior and environmental context, shaping survival.

- The interplay between urgency and anxiety influences decision-making, reflecting complex cognitive processes.

- Evolutionary generalists may possess advantages in diverse environments, challenging traditional views of niche adaptation.

- The historical perspective on free energy enhances comprehension of anticipatory systems in scientific contexts.

- Engaging with the question of "What is life?" opens avenues for exploring biological and philosophical dimensions.

- Understanding the role of context in decision-making can illuminate the distinctions between adaptive behaviors.

- The relationship between structure and function in living systems raises questions about definitions of life.

- Free energy principles encourage a nuanced exploration of life, moving beyond simplistic binary categorizations.
