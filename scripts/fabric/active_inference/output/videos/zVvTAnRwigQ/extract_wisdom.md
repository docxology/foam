# SUMMARY
A presentation discusses predictive coding, sensory perception, and event structures in understanding human behavior and decision-making.

# IDEAS:
- Predictive coding models help explain how our brains interpret sensory information and perceptions.
- Sensory perceptions are influenced by the context of our experiences and expectations.
- The brain actively constructs reality based on available sensory data and prior knowledge.
- Event structures shape our understanding of occurrences and how we interact with them.
- Expectations and uncertainty play crucial roles in shaping our perceptions of future events.
- Active inference allows for continuous adjustment of our mental models based on new information.
- Social interactions are complex systems influenced by feedback and predictions from past experiences.
- Understanding brain functions can lead to improved cognitive models and decision-making processes.
- The interplay between perception and reality is essential in shaping our experiences and responses.
- Contextual factors significantly influence how we interpret sensory information and events.
- The brain's predictive capabilities help navigate complex environments and social situations.
- Effective learning relies on adjusting our mental models based on sensory feedback and experiences.
- Cognitive science provides insights into the mechanisms of human perception and behavior.
- Predictive analytics can enhance our understanding of human interactions and decision-making.
- The brain's interpretation of events is influenced by social contexts and cultural frameworks.
- Future expectations can shape present behavior and influence decision-making processes.

# INSIGHTS:
