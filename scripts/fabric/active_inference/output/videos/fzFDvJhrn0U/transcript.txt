hello and welcome it's June 7th 2023 we're in active live stream 54.1 discussing mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian brain so welcome to the active Institute we're a participatory online Institute that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference this is a recorded in an archive live stream so please provide feedback so we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams to learn more about live streams and other projects head over to activeinference.org and we're here today in active stream 54.1 we are in our first discussion with the author of the work mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian brain today in 54.1 we're going to say hello then be on with it and see where it all goes together so we'll begin with introductions I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California six months ago was quite unfamiliar with category Theory and have had quite a fun Journey with Ali and Dean and I guess Toby via stigmergic proxy so really looking forward to this discussion and I'll pass to Dean and then Ollie thanks Dan I'm Dean I'm here at Calgary um my goal in in joining this group was to take the idea as we got in the one of the previous slides the idea of practicing applied active inference I see the potential through category theory of making that even more accessible more possible and so I'm really excited to have the author with us today and maybe have a look at what that means and I'll pass it over to Ali hello I'm Ali I'm an independent researcher Premier run um and as I said in that zero I'm quite excited uh to be here to discuss this magnificent dissertation with its author uh and uh well I mean in the past several months we did our best to uh understand and dissect it as best as we could but obviously we have many many uh questions uh that I'm looking forward to uh discuss them with so Toby thanks again for joining please lead us off with just any introduction and background that's going to set the stage maybe how the the work came to be and that would be great so thanks again yes great no well thanks Dan and and all of you guys for hosting me and and I need the courage to read my thesis which uh as you noticed it's a kind of strange mix of things it's kind of both the research work and as I noticed um what are you saying in the in the previous stream that it's at this kind of Frontier of knowledge and of course it needs to be but I also because this language is so kind of unfamiliar to people and because I think it you know will prove to be very useful Across The Sciences um I really wanted to make it kind of legible to people so you know for people to read the the thesis but also like my research and kind of understand what I was saying effectively how it came about was yeah I was supposed to be studying um interactions between frontal cortex and hippocampus circuits in the brain and at the sort of time of trying to get started with that um obviously I was kind of interested in the free energy principle and active inference and all of that um but I found that there was a lot of kind of you know as I've said in in the thesis and as you talked about in the previous um stream and probably in previous in discussions before that as well there's a lot of kind of you know each dip each research group has its own language and uh these different groups you know they don't necessarily talk to each other in a way that is kind of an efficient kind of communication each you know group of people is interested in their own thing and one of the things I like about um the free energy principle and about active inference is that it's this nice sort of General framework for adaptive systems and so it is in itself a good place to kind of situate an understanding of systems like the brain um and other adaptive systems but of course it it doesn't you know immediately resolve this problem of well the problem that was for me a kind of confusion about like what's going on in these circuits and how should I understand what one person says in relationship to what another person says about you know this bit of the brain or this interaction and so in the process of kind of trying to understand what was going on there and to resolve in part the confusion I had about predictive coding itself and you know the complexities of all these models I was encountering I kind of resolved to replace that confusion with another kind of confusion which is the you know what is all this crazy category Theory stuff and you know so you might think okay well that's mad what's the point of that you've just made everybody's life a lot harder it's kind of like that XKCD comic where you've got all of these different standards and you know we decided to like come together and and make a new standard and in fact this is happening I think and like I don't know what it was in in cellular biology maybe I heard John Baez talking about this yesterday that you know they have lots of different standards for writing down diagrams for describing like interacting like biological processes and the other kind of scientific community in in that area has set up a kind of mediating body to kind of try to you know form like bring together all of these diagram languages um but they weren't really able to do so so they still they instead of just coming up with one new standard they came up with three new standards to try to unify these things and the travel you know I had or have with these different languages or different sort of syntaxes for talking about scientific things is that not only are they all different but they're kind of all ad hoc and so the reason why I feel that there's promise in replacing this confusion of this of of so many different ideas I mean of girls it's great to have this kind of ecosystem of ideas about how these complicated systems work but it's still very ad hoc and confusing and so instead of just coming up with a new ad hoc and confusing way of understanding these things I was kind of hoping to use a language which is maybe kind of universal in some sense like it's really about or it's really capturing like how we think and maybe also like how the world is actually you know built up um but in particular it seems to capture something of how we think and so you know the fundamental theorem of category Theory says that you shall know a concept by the company it keeps to adapt the kind of that that sort of motto of I think um birth from Linguistics that you should know a word by the company it keeps um that that's really like at the heart of how we come to understand things in the world and I think the math that is category Theory captures that very nicely and very precisely and at the same time enforces a kind of discipline and so I know it is quite like hard going reading this kind of research work this kind of introduction to all this new stuff but you know in part that's because you know when you're being disciplined is hard and doing things very formally precisely does require a bit of well you know a lot of uh dedication um but that isn't to say that it's not worth it or that these ideas even used a bit informally somewhere down the line might not be useful at least to sort of frame the way we think about things um so I hope to be you know some use in helping not only sort of change the confusions that we have but also like modulate them in a kind of way that will be sort of useful for people awesome great starting place Ali ordin where can we um begin how can we replace some of our prior confusions with a new and different confusion all you want to go first yeah can I ask a quick question of Toby Toby when you were talking about when you actually saw all of these standards so you know you were the sort of what you were the you were the Hub of all of these standards you saw sort of all around you can you maybe speak to the idea of what you perceived or what you sensed was the stabilizing function of those standards but also the searching function because of course you had gone out and realized there were all of these different standards at play I remember it in a in a previous professional life of mine having to have um Chief Financial officers and their math sit sit at the table with engineers and their math and them talking right past one another and making no sense to each other and I had to be kind of the medium between them so that their math would actually get a little bit sticky and they'd be actually be able to understand and interpret one another in your in your experience with this how did that play out the both the stabilization through the standards and the search well I I I guess I should begin by saying that I'm um existed still this is still like ongoing and nor am I an expert in all of these different standards um but the thing that I kind of at least noticed right that was that people use languages like you know Bayesian inference or reinforcement learning or dynamical systems to talk about certain bits of the brain that I was interested in um and they kind of just plug all these ideas together and it sometimes and it's fine so you want to write a paper and it's about a particular phenomenon and it's great you maybe come up with some nice model and you you know you put people in MRI scanners and that the the quantities and the you know in the sort of bold signal correspond to quantities in your model and that's that's great it says that maybe this bit of the brain is doing that um I mean we can argue about MRI at some other time but it doesn't really tell you about how that little model you've got interacts with the rest of the brain or the rest of the world and so if you care about like this whole complicated thing you want to know how do these parts actually talk to each other um and so I was just fortunate at this kind of beginning of this um in some sense to be in the right place at the right time so I kind of knew there were these different you know ingredients all being put into these different models and you know only yeah I'm only sort of familiar with some of them but I could still see that they had sort of similar structure and that was in part because I had been going to you know some applied category Theory meetings or talks and seen that say um economic games which are very closely related to reinforcement learning have this kind of bi-directional structure where an agent tries to sort of effectively in some sense choose they make an observation and they sort of do this kind of forward projecting kind of thing and choosing an action at the same time as saying okay well if supposing I take this action like what would the payoff be and that's this kind of backwards facing thing and then you can sort of chain that process and think well if I do this in multiple stages like how does the utility I get at the end of this yeah multi-stage process like feedback to the utility I'm going to get having taken just one step right now and that's kind of that's a similar sort of bi-directional thing to what happens in active info or like in well in predictive coding specifically where uh like a little circuit is saying okay well I need given that my like high level beliefs about what's causing this like sensory data I need to sort of retro fits the actual sensory data to kind of come up with a new belief about what those causes are and so that seemed to me to have the same kind of structure um a similar thing also happens in um back prop in machine learning where you have say some neural network in it and it kind of you know you feed forward some information through the network and it say does a classification and then you have some some training system which says okay well actually you have this error and then you need to sort of back propagate that to update you know say some parts of the model on the basis of that so that also has this kind of bi-directional structure um and it just was fortunate that at this time people were talking talking a lot about these kind of bi-directional processes and you know so I was thinking about these things at the same time I was kind of thinking about you know the application of Bayesian inference and I kind of noticed that you know they had the same structure and I kind of wanted to figure out what was going on there like really sort of pinned down what what it was that made like this kind of predictive coding circuit have this kind of shape in some sense because as I think you've also talked about um and as I've kind of mentioned a few minutes ago that you know individual predictive coding circuit isn't an isolated system right it's part of like this hierarchical thing and so you have one little circuit connected to another circuit and that whole conglomeration of circuitry is supposed to do something quite Grand but at the same time it's made of smaller parts um and I think the the main one of the major confusions I had at the beginning was okay so you have this like big um generative model with lots and lots of factors and you go through it and you try to derive like the differential equations that give you the sort of predictive coding Dynamics by saying okay well yeah we're going to minimize the free energy and you have this complicated thing with lots of sums in it and it seems like very intimidating to try to like come up with that differential equation even though actually when you sort of look at this the kind of the look at the process that you're doing is quite kind of mechanical because effectively you're doing the same transformation to each factor of this model and so that also hinted that there was this kind of compositionality thing going on in these systems okay you not only do you see that these kind of this bit of the brain is has this kind of modularity but you also get a sense of that modularity in that derivation you're doing um and so what I wanted to do was to capture both of these things one is the kind of shape of the circuitry and the other is like how to somehow save the efforts of having to kind of red arrive everything reach different case and that kind of formalization of this process corresponds to a kind of functor reality you get when effectively the functor reality means you preserve compositional structure and so what you want to do is you want to say okay well what's the compositional structure of the thing that the function starts with like the process starts with and that's the compositional structure of Bayesian inference itself and then you want to say okay well what's the compositional structure of the kind of dynamical systems which is the thing you're trying to get to and how do you map from one to the other in a way that preserves that structure and so that's kind of what I was doing in this thesis is just saying okay what are the structures I need and how do I relate them um and you know it turned out that there were a lot of details that I had to write them all down um but the kind of basic idea I hope is quite simple it's just trying to say what are those kind of sim like the kind of individual components like the kind of Lego plots and how do they like connect together and how can I sort of you know relate this the kind of Lego blocks of one thing with the Lego box of another in a way that's kind of preserves the shapes um and so yeah it's it's kind of is kind of Mammoth thing but the kind of fundamental idea is quite simple and I think it's kind of like how when if you're if you're like programming a computer you can write in a high level language or you can write something like low-level language and if you wanted to you could write in Assembly Language and category theory is like a language where you start with the kind of Assembly Language and you build up a high level language within the language itself in some sense and so if you really want to start with at the very beginning like I did with the definition of category and then build up to this big thing you have to make a lot of steps because like Assembly Language is really simple and it's you know it's just like single instructions that your processor does and so getting all the way to something like Zoom that can do a video call is quite complicated and so people don't they start with a high level language but the thing that people strive for in designing high-level languages is to set them up in such a way that they're sort of the the abstractions are quite nice or sort of modular and so that's what I'm trying to do with using category theory is to kind of find abstractions that are modular in a similar kind of way and I know um on the previous call um Dan you mentioned um the the kind of analogy between like typing in this category theoretic sense and in the programming sense and they're quite similar um the category Theory sense is kind of a much sort of more General bigger idea it has a lot it sort of incomes there's all kinds of things um but you could imagine somewhere down the line having a programming language and that you know people are trying to build these things but having a programming language where you could express anything you could in you know category Theory and you know I to be honest find it quite intense and quite sometimes mechanical and tedious how to prove that certain categorical structures satisfies the coherence conditions that it has to satisfy like you know lacks associativity or monoidality or something like this there are a lot of like diagrams you have to check commute or something and much of the time that checking is quite tedious and someday I hope that we all have tools that we could say okay well I'm going to spell out what my structure is and the tool will just check that it satisfies all the axioms and so you know I know you guys had to Wade through a lot of that stuff in the thesis but it's kind of meant manually necessary right now but in the future it might not be and then we can use this high-level language in a much more kind of liberal way I hope that would be great sorry I've been roughly overrated so I'll stop there awesome great or go to a question in the chat Mark wrote applied category Theory and active inference have tremendous promise I confess I have not yet read this dissertation it would be helpful to describe a specific engineering application for the work so what do you see as approximate and and or distal engineering applications here so one of the things that I hope could be produced soon as an engineering application is a general modeling framework for building kind of complicated active inference systems that might include lots of Parts lots of you know agents um kind of like um something that my colleague Jules Hedges wants in cybernetics more generally something like kind of programming language maybe that incorporates um all of these kind of strange cybernetic structures I mentioned earlier like reinforcement learning and like back propping machine learning and Bayesian inference they all have this kind of bi-directionality and so you should be able to have this kind of modeling environment which allows you to incorporate all of these things in a kind of nice way um but I think before we get something quite as Grand as a whole new sort of modeling environment I think just having tools to help us build um you know approximate an active inference systems that are really nicely compositional is is one thing that I you know hope to come out of this uh to be honest I don't know very well what the general tooling is like for this kind of thing right now I know that there's SPM I know that there's like Pi mdp for certain kinds of problem um but I don't know how sort of General they are um another thing that you would get if you have this kind of toolkit because of the kind of modularity of category theory is you you should be able to plug it into other things that exist already so um one of the things that's particularly of interest to me at the moment is kind of multi-agent systems um and sort of building trying to understand how we could build um something like or simulate things like you know something like a corporation or some kind of yeah some kind of society structure where you've got lots of active inference agents coming together to pursue a sort of common shared goal um how can you kind of effectively distribute that goal sharing across systems they could be like little robotic systems say or something like that or you know agent or like I I don't know because precisely I'm kind of like an abstract thinker but I yeah I think like being able to kind of control or like modulate the performance of these kind of distributed multi-agent like active infant systems might be quite a cool thing yeah to be able to build so that that's kind of like a kind of maybe sort of flavor the kind of thing this tooling gives you um I suppose for me this particular work was really about trying to encourage people to use this language to understand things more clearly um so yeah there's a lot of stuff that I hope we can understand well at least I can understand more clearly um sure awesome thank you Ali thank you uh yes so in this paper by uh Christoph walterwitch um are there category theoretical explanations of physical phenomena he argues that category Theory by itself does not and cannot provide any mathematical explanations for a physical phenomena so the idea here is that a category theory is merely a meta Theory to kind of uh to what kind of bookkeeping or house holding of the physical theories and it's not a tool to construct the mathematical theory of physical phenomena itself uh I'm not sure I agree with this argument entirely because um in one sense some of the most profound aha moments in the history of science obviously results from looking at a pre-existing Theory or a model from a novel angle and I believe category Theory can provide such novel perspectives even when looking at some established and pre-existing models or theories so what do you uh I'm curious to know uh your opinion about this so do you think uh category Theory can actually provide uh mathematical explanations for uh I mean either in cognitive science Neuroscience or even other areas other scientific disciplines as well I think it's a it's a subtle question um right now it's probably largely the case that the role of category theory is kind of this I'm not I think it's like like bookkeeping but like clarification too um bookkeeping if you think of it as a very general way of like trying to account for the the things you're thinking about very precisely and not sort of Miss details like if you your books don't balance you can't miss some payment or some debt um I think that's quite a nice analogy but I think one of the goals of quite a lot of people or not maybe I mean the fair chunk of the community um particularly that which comes from a sort of more abstract mathematical side of um category Theory um one of their goals is to try to recast a lot of how we think in kind of purely categorical language so one of the things that category Theory allows us to do is to kind of formalize in some sense patterns that crop up all over the place using the notion of universal Construction and the thing about Universal constructions is that you have like some little pattern and if you know that you can instantiate that pattern in your category that you have like some object which kind of captures the essence of that pattern and you don't need to say be able to kind of write down all of the specifics of that object you know sort of a priori because the kind of universality gives you a recipe for constructing it it gives you it in in some sort of unique way and so you know that if you have this universality you can always you can always like access this object and yeah so I'm talking very generally but because of that um one thing that people try to do is to try to say okay well what it you know we've got these things that we're interested in um in say physics like you know the principle of least action or like the nature of um space time or something like that can we express those things as kind of universal constructions um all for instance in a completely different realm like we may have some process which is something that we're interested in on the computer like um the migration of data and databases can we write that down in a way that doesn't have any kind of ad hoc ingredients it only is built from Universal constructions these are things that we can just write down kind of abstract sort of axioms in the language of category Theory and that kind of gives us the the process or the structure that we that we want um this kind of line of work is often called like synthetic something like synthetic um you know probability Theory or synthetic um physics or synthetic topology or something like that and it means you sort of start from these kinds of very high level categorical ideas and then you sort of end up with a characterization of the essence of the thing you're interested in in physics I kind of um a simple example of this um which I Supply in a kind of relatively feeble efforts to say that it's not true that pedigree Theory doesn't give you a characterization of things in um physics so there is a category of say topological spaces and the morphisms between them are continuous functions and there's amorphism a category rather of sets and the morphism between the sets are functions and of course underlying every continuous function is a plane function and so there is a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of sets which just forgets the the topological structure of the spaces because every topological space has an underlying set of points so you have this forgetful bunker and this forgetful functor has two adjoints and one of the things the category Theory teaches you is that adjunctions give you this universality so adjoint functors are characterized uniquely by their kind of the satisfaction of this adjunction property so these two adjoints to this forgetful functor one gives you what are called um discrete spaces so if you take a set you can turn it into a topological Space by thinking of all the points as little Islands in this space so there's no like connectivity between them and that's called a kind of discrete space on that set and the other adjoint functor gives you what's called the Indiscreet or sometimes co-discrete space where all of the points are sort of collected into one big like Island so you they're also connected together so it's like a sort of fully connected graph and of course that's very different from the discrete space and it's different from like the space time or the space that you live in um which has a particular kind of you know connectivity like you can't walk through walls um and so you know people try to use these things particularly use adjunctions to characterize things like Properties or spaces another thing that comes out to a jointness um and this is something that like um can let you read about uh later because it'll take me the rest to talk to try to explain um but the you might be familiar from logic that you have these quantifiers you have existential and Universal quantifiers um and you can do things with these quantifiers like you can say um you could sort of compose them together so you get things like for all X there exists a y such that this and you can think sometimes of these Composites or these compositions of quantifiers as like maybe like modal operators like you can sort of decompose necessity and possibility in terms of the compositions of of logical quantifiers but the kind of weird thing about bondifiers is that they too arise out of an adjunction um it's kind of like they are left and right adjoints to substitution so if you have a proposition you can like substitute the term intimate and the the adjunction the adjoint punctures to substitution give you the quantifiers and you can sort of take this another step and then you can think about like composing these adjoint functors and those give you the modal operators and so that's something that comes just out of category Theory but it's really sort of fundamental in in sort of logic and you know we might think there's a kind of close relationship between physics and computation or physics and logic um or you know physics and information and information and computation and if and logic so I think it's not quite true that there's nothing to be gained from um thinking about kind of traditional mathematical things uh or traditional physical things using category theory in some sense they you know doing that really clarifies the essence of them um because it tells you what their kind of universal properties are and you can then like instantiate those things in different contexts so one of the things that you could do is start to think about these kind of logical structures in different contexts and that's kind of like what type theory is all about and you could use it to think about the logic of like dynamical systems or you could use it to try to characterize um say like the Universal Property even of the free energy principle and that's something that I like to think about sometimes like how can we think about active inference systems as like trying to achieve their goals is that is that related to these Junctions that you know come up in sort of foundations of logic when you look at them categorically and if it is then that's quite profound because it tells you that you know maybe the fep does have this kind of universality that people want to claim it does um so I think you know it it is true that right now because it's quite early days um category theory is kind of mostly used for bookkeeping but I guess that might be because um there's quite a lot of bookkeeping to do before we can make the most of this kind of move um make the most of using these kind of universal structures and maybe one day further in the future where people are more familiar with this kind of language and we have this you know big library of categorical tools and yeah our computer program our computer sort of modeling environments and programming languages know how to like import stuff from this category just really easily and so you don't have to do all this kind of tedious manual stuff maybe like in the future in that future it'll be much more common just to say okay well we're going to start to model things using these Universal properties you know off the bat rather than trying to sort of retrofit them awesome thank you Toby Ollie uh yes thank you so much for your detailed answer and uh again I have a follow-up question to that so there's this view in philosophy of science that views scientific theories um as not as a kind of Monolithic uh I mean phenomena or model but rather any given scientific theory can be viewed as a population of models so some of those models are more fundamental than the others and um or in terms of manual the Land There are virtual and actual part of each of Any Given scientific model so the idea here is that uh the actual part of scientific models uh try to capture the context dependent uh behavior of phenomena or any physical system but on the other hand the virtual or more fundamental part of scientific models or theories try to somehow capture it's more abstract and abstract model of the phenomena in terms of its topological invariance so do you think the category Theory can provide a rigorous language to somehow unify this view of science uh I mean and to see how exactly those context dependent part of scientific theories fit or at least can be compatible with the context independent part of scientific theory is or the virtual part uh because you see uh in the context dependent uh or actual models uh scientists usually try to refine their models to fit the data as close as possible or at least approximately uh close enough to be useful but for the more fundamental Parts uh comprising of principles axioms and so on they only try to capture the topological um terrain or or the uh I mean the topological invariance of the models and how models can be compared in terms of their uh singularities and topological shapes yeah that does sound very familiar I don't know this kind of work or idea um in any you know I I haven't come across this before but it does sound something that's quite amenable and in fact you know there seems to be at least in my mind some alignment between this kind of sense of virtual that you're talking about and this kind of universality that I was talking about um so you could think of you know a category of models of particular kinds as being like inhabited by all of those things which satisfy these invariants and then you have different you know individual instances of these things um which would be like the objects of the category and then the the differences between them other you know the morphisms and the thing about morphism in the category is that often they are the things which preserve the structure uh in other bits of mathematics they're called homomorphisms and that's where the word morphism comes from and so you could think of those as they you know ways of comparing the models or translating the models from one to the other um but preserving those invariants yeah and so that that seems to me to capture some of the idea that you were sketching um I guess one thing which may or may not be useful depending on how you look at it um the category Theory gives you is it's obviously kind of a lot more General and so it allows you to talk about invariance of kinds that you know more than just um game excuse me um more than just topological um in subsets like functor reality is a kind of um in like it kind of captures the kind of invariance as well and saying okay well we preserve this structure um each I mean one just one way of like looking at a topological spaces to take its um it's what's called it's nerve and so that that takes a topological space and turns it into a category and you could sort of think of the the morphisms in that category as like the the sort of like the paths in that space or ways to sort of get from one sort of part of the space to another um and then you know morphisms functors between topological spaces considered in categories like that they really are just things that preserve those topological structures um and so easily like this this language kind of seems to Encompass the kinds of things you're saying um yeah yeah it would be nice yeah I would I would love somebody to you know make that connection oh oh just follow up on this and then Dean it's a it's a um related comment from Roman in the chat Roman wrote uh quoted you in this fractal quote streaming thinking about the fep through category theory in relation to goals maybe allows to prove that fep has the universality that people claim it has and Roman asks didn't Maxwell ramstead and Dalton's octave devel already kind of proved this in the Bayesian mechanics physics of and by belief work so you're talking about the role of generalization what do we gain with the category theorification of fep beyond for example the generalizations that we've seen in Bayesian mechanics and G Theory over the last year yeah that's a it's a question um I think Maxwell and Dalton are doing a great job um formalizing the ideas of Bayesian mechanics but that as far as I'm aware the job isn't done yet um and so I haven't yet seen yeah I mean I have a particular aesthetic right and I would like I would like to see a really clear recipe of a way to take of like on the one hand some like or like some machine that takes in that has like a particular shape but it's like input shape and it takes in like a dynamical system of a particular kind and it gives me back um like uh the the specification of an inference problem so that that amical system is solving um I think that's what Daisy mechanics is saying it's saying okay well if we have a dynamical system that is somehow kind of you could sort of look at it and say it has a boundary it's a Markov blanket um that you can write down its Dynamics as if it were doing free energy minimization that is solving some inference problem um but there's a lot of and I so I think that statement is true for certain classes of dynamical systems but it's not I don't think the story has been made like like the questions for me are like what are the classes um and what are their what's the essence of those dynamical systems so if the result might just depend on like specific technical criteria which maybe you think okay well like that that's kind of like a distraction from this kind of abstract principle which we're trying to get at and so it'll be nice to sort of know what the actual like Essence is of the problem that allows us to do this translation and then you know there seems to be to be like questions of I mean other fairly technical questions but questions about things like well what is this boundary thing like how long does it persist and what does it mean to separate the thing off and consider it as having a boundary um most of the treatments I've seen of this idea have not been done I've not been explained or expressed in uh in this compositional way and so they just assume you're given a system and a boundary and then that's kind of it um but you know boundaries come in all kinds of shapes um like the boundaries of the cells in my body are kind of all like glued together in a particular way and they form me and I also have a boundary um and so how do the kind of local inference problems that are being solved by those individual cells given their gluing amount to the kind of inference problem that my whole body is solving um and I don't think an answer to that has you know is anywhere near given right now um and yet obviously we're you know we look at systems out in the world and they all seem to display this property of re-energy minimization or at least something that looks a lot like it and so it would be nice to be able to relate those um those kind of inference problems to one another um so I think there's still a lot to be done um just just because we've kind of made some First Steps doesn't mean that we're all of the way there um but obviously given my Aesthetics what I would love to see is this kind of abstract characterization of this universality um and I think I yeah I think there's a way of stating well at least the structure of that Universal Property um using this compositional act of inference language of which the thesis is apart but effectively it seems to be something like this adjoint thing that I was talking about earlier so you on the one hand you have a like a something like a functor that takes um statistical problems and gives you dynamical systems that kind of solve those inference problems and so that's a function from like you know statistical yeah what I call statistical gains into that and consistent of some kind but of course you have lots of dynamical systems and say you know what this um Bayesian mechanics idea seems to be saying is that you can go the other way as well and maybe this mapping in the other direction is also factorial and that would be a way of characterizing this kind of gluing together of dynamical systems like I was talking about cells and ending up with maybe dynamical statistical games that also have this kind of gluing property um but there's still a fair amount of work to be done even to get like the basic framework to spell out that story precisely um it was work that I'm trying to slowly get on with at the moment um but I think you know some you know the ingredients to to doing this in the kind of generality that I would like that's starting to become clear um and so hopefully we get there but I don't think it's I don't think it's sold yet awesome yes just so cool to see all these paths weaving together Dean I I think it's awesome Toby that you in this conversation have kind of anti-captored adjointness and comma jointness because I think that's a huge part of your work here and and reading it so here's my here's my question I I think and I would like you to maybe comment on this as though you were explaining it to a very curious 15 year old so on the sort of most basic level when I hear under sort of a common adjointness principle the word bookkeeping I immediately Wonder okay so what is the partner what's the what's the thing that's being glued to to use your metaphor and so I would glue it to taking receipts essentially where you have a stabilization of a record under bookkeeping so I get that part and then the taking receipts is the stabilization of the change function right the The Exchange something that we receive those two things seem to kind of work together which then allows for compositionality and all that other stuff but maybe I wonder if maybe you could kind of speak to this idea that something is presented to us and then what the category Theory does is allows us to now start working with so where does this fit does this fit under this superordinate of being a tool or does it fit under this column directly adjacent as a as a rule like that's the part where I think the adjointness could be really really helpful in terms of maybe helping people see the applicability and not just the abstraction what's what's your thoughts on that so I mean I I yeah so I think um David Spivak talks about category Theory as being light a kind of accounting system um or accounting systems plural for mathematics and I I think he's kind of quite right then so the way I the way I see it is like um when you you know when you're keeping books um particularly if you're sort of using like this double entry system you're trying to keep track of the stuff that kind of flows into and out of your account uh your company or whatever it is um without sort of missing some bits you see where everything goes and so that's how I think of this kind of mathematical language you have this stuff um and it's kind of like some like abstract collection of things some like maybe mathematical ideas and well a functor takes that stuff and does something with it and turns it into some stuff of another kind um but yeah it's like this kind of Double Entry idea but you know when you take something out of here you have to put it in here and so you have to sort of keep track of all the details at least all of the details that are relevant to those two to that flow I suppose and so when you have an adjunction you have a way of going from one place to another and Back Again without losing trackers and stuff um it's like a little bit kind of like you're allowed to lose track of some stuff but you you know the stuff you've lost track of because you don't care about it like you know it like you know you might you might allow or some you know have some like butter there but you know how big your buffer is something like that so like a little bit like more precisely like in a junction is a way to map from one category to another and and Back Again in such a way that like the the two mappings are kind of like like ideal approximations of the inverse of some of each other and that you can sort of measure the difference between between them um they sort of like give you it gives you like an isomorphism of between the two sets of morphisms of some kind and that that kind of gives you this nice kind of structure preservation property this kind of bookkeeping property um I don't I mean so I know that there there are people out there um who have used um category Theory to um model stock flow diagrams and so these are used in economics to measure you know stop flows of stocks and things like that but they also use an epidemiology to model you know the transmission of disease because that's also like um a flow of some stock you have people moving around um and so I you know it would be nice to sort of bring this idea full circle and have this mathematical language of bookkeeping actually applied to bookkeeping um but I don't I I haven't I don't know how that would go just yet but but like you know if we think of if we think of economies and corporations as as adaptive systems or if we somehow kind of translate from blows of money to like flows of information but there does seem to be like an analogy between that kind of flow and the kind of flows that we think of in active inference explicitly um and you know another thing yeah one of the things I liked about category theory is it allows us to make these analogies in a precise way and so maybe we can you know relate these two things quite clearly I mean I you know it's yet to be done but I would love to see it awesome Dean smiles when his keywords are buzzed during a response we'll go to another great question in the chat from Matt n Matt wrote can you provide some ideas about the next necessary steps or milestones for categorical Theory to be effectively utilized across research and in subsequent engineering applications and I'll just kind of append to that what do you think at the individual team and organizational scale what can we do what Milestones exist to realize some of these engineering applications and implications that you brought up right so I think the main thing possibly unfortunately for you guys who spent a lot of time reading the details I wrote is that kind of have this community um develop to a stage where the tools that I mentioned that allow us to kind of use these category theoretic Concepts fluently without having to know all of those like boring and complicated details to develop those to a stage where people are actually you know able to use them without being kind of like mathematicians or category Theory domain experts um so this is I think starting to happen I guess yeah as a result of the kind of needs of the pandemic people have developed these tools for epidemiology I mentioned this stock flows stuff and I think you know you can probably there's like some I can't remember what it's called unfortunately now um so in the Julia programming language there's this great framework for use for kind of building system using category Theory Concepts um but of course this doesn't satisfy the property of not having to be a category Theory domain expert yet on top of that people have built using compositional ideas about Dynamics Frameworks for you know Building compositional dynamical Systems and like compositional models for things like epidemiology and stuff like that and you know hopefully we'll get there also with um you know statistical modeling and active inference and all that stuff but what you know once once you've got that kind of lower level Library people can start to build like user interfaces on top of it and that's the thing that's starting to happen now with the stock flow stuff um and I think the people involved in that project are I mean they know that there's like one kind of heat like major like proprietary tool for doing this kind of modeling which is used for you know it's used by lots of different organizations for instance it was used by governments for modeling during the pandemic but it's not like it's not very collaborative it's it's not compositional so if you like have this huge model it's very hard to like deal with like to modulate just some small part of it and so these people are as I say it's very unfortunate I can't remember all their names um or the name of the software but they're building this tool which allows you to build up these models just using this interface but it's built out of this compositional stuff um and so it has a lot of the nice properties that come out of it and of course you if you if you want you can sort of delve onto the hood and understand like actually how it works and connect it to all this other stuff and maybe down the line when we've got really Advanced tools that that will kind of be able to be done for free and some nice user interface but I think you know so if if people want to make the most of this you know they can sort of get it involved with that kind of effort or at least they could sort of get familiar with the kind of basic ideas of you know categorical modeling or compositional thinking as I like to say these days um but I don't I also don't want to like prescribe to people they have to know what like a monad is and all that stuff because you know there are it is technical it has to be technical because it's about technical stuff but I mean it's also trying to be ergonomic and yeah if if that's your thing you can try to help make it more so awesome Dean no I I I I I'm waiting because there's a there's a part of the paper that that belief updating and the fuzzy of distributions and stuff I'm gonna want to talk about that later but I'm I'm done for now all right I'll go to a question submitted by Jr also who created the syllabus so thanks again Jr for that amazing work so Jr wrote um in compositional active inference from May 17 2021 Toby said I'm with Valeria on this I think we need to seek AI alignment for the artificial intelligences that we already have things like corporations and social systems and we should be concentrating on those right now could you speak more about how you envision this kind of application this is especially interesting in light of what we spoke about in the 54.0 regarding Sensor Fusion and consensus what might this mean for corporations and social systems Toby do you mean that uh this between humans and things kind of like artificial intelligences or machines and artificial intelligences in the context of companies and societies yeah that's a great question and I think you know jl's done a great job with the syllabus which I also had a look at um yeah yeah I think it's a good it's a good it's a good like list of um material and Concepts to sort of get get to grips with um but as the yeah AI alignment it's a very vexed issue of course um I know I mean I've put this to people who are involved in the um AI safety community and some of them say oh well we concentrate on machine intelligent rather than corporations because there's like no hope for making corporations safe like it's too late they're already out there so we can't fix that which is obviously a very sort of defeatist attitude but maybe it's right um to concentrate on a matter where they think that they can actually have an influence um but I do nonetheless still think that corporations are like super intelligences we they've been made out of code but the code isn't a traditional computer programming language it's the legal programming language that makes up their contracts but those contracts will determine how they operate and are executed on a thing which is a bit like a computer like the legal system um you know you go into court it processes the contract and it explains what the outcome is going to be it's a you know it's like a computer but it's like made up of people um and you know they have you know goals and yeah desires and they take actions and they receive information from the world and so yeah they're a lot like um well yeah AI systems but it's nice because we can pun on AI and have it mean both artificial intelligence and active influence um so yeah so that's like a long Preamble um one of the things that at least as far as I know right now the active immigrants literature doesn't talk an awful lot about at least not very precisely is this notion of sense of fusion so you can have like two say you have like two yeah so if you think about the brain again you've got like two like neural little neural circuits next to each other and they're making predictions about two visual receptive fields um but those visual receptive Fields they kind of often overlap and so what we might want a system like the brain to do is to be able to kind of glue the two inferences that those circuits made together over this overlap so that you get like this you know unitary perception like we don't just see a bunch of independent patches of the world we see like this kind of glued together thing even though you know the way it's been in third is through lots of like individual systems next to one another and so it's it's quite you know on you know it's quite clear how to put two things next to each other mathematically you just take their sort of product um that you do then you just do them side by side but when you need to when you want them to sort of glue together in this way um you might encounter some problems like you might have one make one inference and one make another inference and so you get like a disagreement and then you need to start to say okay well what's what's going on there like what is the nature of this disagreement is it saying that can be resolved by like say you know passing some messages between the two systems or do we need to just like ignore some of the data or is there fundamentally some like Paradox which means that we can't resolve this disagreement excuse me um and so in mathematics there's a lot of theory that's been done about precisely this question in topology in a kind of abstract way um related to the field of what's called cohomology which is all about like measuring like obstructions to doing this kind of gluing thing and sort of in this world of like applied topology people talk about um algorithms for resolving disagreements and and things like that and they often have the flavor of like diffusion you can sort of think of diffusion as like smoothing out disagreements like because you're just sort of like letting stuff propagate um something there maybe could be said about like how these diffusion models work in generative AI but I haven't really thought about that um and so you know maybe maybe there's something to be done for you know political systems or corporations like maybe we can look at how you know the mathematics says we can resolve these disagreements and Implement better processes in our organizations that are inspired by those algorithms or kind of universal properties and you know maybe that'll make the world a kind of more harmonious place or maybe it will just help us build um you know systems in the future which resolve disagreements better and this is one of the reasons why I was um talking about you know multi-agent systems before um I know this is the thing that sometimes people think about in the context of you know blockchain systems and things like that which are actually actively composed of lots of different participants um but I don't know yet how we yeah my all pan out I mean ultimately you know the question of alignment is really about do the goals of this other system um disagree with my goals and you know if the other system has more power than you then ultimately there's probably not much you can do about it regardless of whether there's oh that where there exists some algorithm that might help you smooth it out um so I I think I I hope at least that by looking at how like the mathematics says we can optimally resolve disagreements or smooth them out or patch things together or build kind of multi-agent systems that will help us build things in the future in such a way that we don't get to a situation where the systems we're working with are actually aligned against us say um but obviously we can't really guarantee it we actually have to sort of do some work but it's nice that at least um the framework of active inference allows us to talk about that at least right so you know we can say like oh I have these beliefs about the world and there's other agent that has these beliefs about the world and then you know we can express these beliefs in a mathematical framework which is amenable to using these tools from cohomology and applied topology to be able to start to make use of that work that's already being done um it's to me not so clear how you would do that if you're not working in this active inference world and you're working say with just reinforcement learning um I I know there are similar questions about how to kind of glue together preference functions in economics um and I think for me the simplest way to kind of understand those questions is to kind of turn those preference functions into distributions Over States and then use this kind of um sort of more active inferency language so think about it um so yeah again we don't you know we're just at the start of this process but like it sounds like we should be able to you know make use of this wealth of tooling which has been developed in other fields um because we're putting this into this kind of modular categorical language we should be able to kind of you know put put these two modules together and make make the most of them thanks I'm gonna go to a different sort of question here I'm a new uh play dissertation roulette but I kind of know where I'm going to go and uh I'm gonna skip to a diagram it's a diagram at the end of chapter six and it looks like this so what do we see here what happens in this graphical arrangement it doesn't have to be ultra specific about defining every variable but does right what is what matters here that's apology or the geometry is it an arbitrary visual layout but you're conveying something about the connectivity or is it read from left to right or is there a certain way to understand or just approach these diagrams which in slightly smaller forms or larger forms we see peppered throughout category Theory and your dissertation so okay yeah so here what I'm trying to do is say that if you have a like hierarchical predictive coding system if you if you take like the form of two parts that are sort of plugged into one another and this is the the G and the h if you like do predictive coding on G and you sort of plug that into h and then you do predictive coding on H with that input it's the same thing as doing predictive coding directly on the two parts as if they were one thing at the start so what I mean is if you have so like here we've got like a hierarchical system again the parts of the hierarchy are G and H and we could do two things we could either apply predictive coding to the two parts and then glue those predictive coding systems together or we could glue like the G and H together and then apply predictive coding to GH the glued system and what this bit of this result is saying is if you do those two processes you get the same dynamical system and that's that's saying that this predictive coding thing um at least with this sort of laplacian scheme is functorial so in this diagram um it is red from left to right I mean of some sense you know you can Orient these diagrams however you want as long as you're clear about how you how the information flows um and if I remember rightly what would what we've got is we've got some like um a yes we've got X and Y so I think um so we've got one system which is predicting X and one system which is predicting why and I'm not totally sure what p and Q are but I guess they relate to X and Y EP um and you've got some stuff that's coming into the predictive coding system h of G and some other stuff which is coming in and going to H of H and these give you like updated States so in predictive coding with this LaPlace algorithm what happens is that you you know you get this new observation that comes in and you look at the error on you know your you know between that observation and your prediction and you update your prediction according to the sort of direction that error points you in and so that's what these HG and H systems are doing but because it's a hierarchical system this like second layer which yeah the second layer requires you to take in the prediction of the first layer so if you sort of follow in the flow of information h h akes in inputs from gamma gamma is the kind of um the predictive channel the predictive part of G and so that feeds into h and the update of G which is a little layer above age requires the the newly updated belief from H right so that's going sort of up in the causal hierarchy and so if you sort of follow the flow in as well into this G update function at the top h of G you see that it gets an input from the sigma function and that's the that's the new belief emitted by the H system in in this part of the proof at least that was the notation I used and so this is a saying if you do predictive Cody on these two bits it it has this structure which is you know you do the forwards pass down through the system G and then h and that gives you a prediction at the kind of lowest level and then you you take your observation which is I think the thing you get in here in Z yeah that's what Z is it goes into H you get an updated belief that comes out in the form of the sigma and then gets passed to the first level of the hierarchy which is used to give you the highest level belief great well it's awesome because in so many papers we see what I guess people expect and prefer which is you should be able to make a nested model here and have communicating agents here and do sophisticated affective inference in this way and it's like we're already playing with the Legos in a sense and talking about it like it's a total Play Shop so to understand in a way that is worthy of dissertation research some of that substrate it's basic Lego research and how do you know when you're working you describe this as a result how do we know I mean can I just draw a line from here to here or can I just uh make a d and just have D you know connect to gamma what rules do you keep a guidebook or recipe on the table what rules help us know what edges and shapes you can even draw and when you describe the manual checking are you looking for what right so yeah this is this is a good question um so yeah this is like it is like a language so it has a syntax um and that syntax is like I mean it's like the grammar right and it tells you what things make sense to say um and so you only say those things don't we all don't we all no but that but it's it's that's what I am laughing because often you want to like play with the grammar right and so sometimes you're like oh well you know I'm it feels like I'm not allowed to like draw this thing like I'm not allowed to connect this box to this other box in this way but like I really want to do that and it's actually that's not a bad thing you shouldn't do it in that diagram where it doesn't make sense but you should take that feed again and reflect on it and say oh but that's saying that maybe this language this diagram syntax is missing something important and then you should yeah trust your intuitions there and say okay well like actually what do I need to do to this diagram language to make it like allow me to do that move that I wanted to do to draw that thing I wanted to draw and so that that you know suggests that there's like you know you're you're walking down you're walking through like a valley and you can see there's a hill over here and there's something peeking out over it and you're like actually there's nothing over there I need to be able to see and so you have to like move over towards a different place to be able to get to that to that place um and so you should do that right then that's fine but the reason why I said at the beginning don't just draw it in your diagram is because then that means your diagram doesn't mean anything and that's that's worse so it this is part of the reason that it's actually requires using this kind of mathematical formalism really using mathematics generally requires this discipline um because you don't you don't want to say things that don't make sense it's kind of a if you have an intuition you should do it justice and and and like treat it seriously and you know you probably get more out of it by figuring out what's missing so like you know with this particular kind of string diagram language you can't just get used to reading them right so I you know that these little black dots mean copy some information so you if you see the first one or like or like the second one on why you know you go from why you go into this copier and you just send the information to both of those outputs if you read like um Bob cooker's work or say his book on um his book picturing Quantum processes which is all about uh quantum theory using this string diagram language um there's a lot of like there are lots lots of different rules for like stuff you can do with these languages languages like you have colored like spiders equals them which are like colored versions of these black dots and you know you there are things you're allowed to do like if you have two spiders next to each other that are the same color you can sort of merge them to be a spider with like as many legs as the two of them and if they don't have the same color then you can sort of split them apart and like that's that those kinds of those kinds of moves are like you know part of the syntax of this language but it's a it's a human language and so people developed it and they realized that they could do some things and they realize that they couldn't do others and they tried to make the rules of the game you know match the things they wanted to do and you know they ended up with this language which is now used a lot in um Quantum Computing because it's a very sort of like natural language for that problem um so as to like how do you know what kinds of things to draw well here like I was trying to prove punctual reality which is the sort of general property and it says the thing you know says in an abstract way the thing that I started by saying which is like there I was I wanted like h of GH to be the same as eight yeah see here if you see this line the update map the composite system you see I've got um HH after HG well I want that to be the same as H just applied to H after G and so that that says okay well I want these two things to be equal and so what I do is I like draw the two diagrams for the two parts and they okay you draw them out and they first of all they don't look equally like oh that's annoying but then you stare at it for a bit and you reflect on the kind of moves that you're allowed to make you think well okay maybe I can um maybe I can apply this move and it makes the diagrams look a bit more similar and eventually you make the diagrams look the same you've only used rules that you're allowed to use um okay I can see so skimming through to see if it looks like that uh directly in the thesis but like effectively that's what's going on um it's just the rules are a little bit abstract though that being said I know that um sobocinski who's uh researcher in category Theory at Tallinn he's got a project um with a colleague of his to build a a mobile game which is all about making string diagrams equal in this way um and so the idea is that in this game you have like pictures like this and you've got certain moves you can do to manipulate the pictures and that you know and the sort of aim of the game is to like transform one the sort of starting picture into like the sort of gold picture just by applying these moves and as you go through the game the kind of moves you can do become more complicated um but it's I mean it's the same kind of process I'm not sure the game is at the stage now where you're allowed to like do this like human creative thing and think actually I want to like make that be a new kind of move or change the diagrams or like add in a color here or something like that's a really human thing and you know designed to say you shouldn't do that but I'm just trying to advocate for do that in a way which is also rigorous awesome awesome yes to speak fluently the syntax and the grammar whether we're talking about natural human language or we're talking about the active inference ontology we want the syntax to be unobtrusive if not compressient so that we can actually convey the semantics because that's the real information flow the syntax is within the Shannon signal entropy space and then in live stream 17 and 4D and the physics as information processing with Chris Fields where we've been exploring these semantic Bayesian information flows that must out of necessity to be enriched beyond the syntax have to include an individual or shared context that flow necessitates the proper syntax and so it's just um part of the learning and so it's exciting to see that there's games and work like yours and others to help because um if we could play with those Legos and get the instantaneous feedback just like learning with a language tutor of like no these two pieces they don't fit together and then it just it we kind of um would actively infer patterns make our own rules and understandings but there would be certain compositionality of the system itself and so it's interesting to think of like you described it as a natural language it is Technical and naturally arising and our natural language without going too much into the superior Wharf and everything like that it reflects the kind of subject object verb structure that we often want to convey this is a natural language for science it conveys what we want to convey and so being able to do that in a way that is both disciplined and rigorous also enabling low cognitive overhead fluency for some individuals today but for more tomorrow that's just extremely powerful and the fact that it has like such a beautiful and intuitive way to graphically represent it is um very promising because that may tap us into a more holistic understanding and a visual field uh or a felt sense understanding that just looking at this and someone says wait this is what we learn in active inference it's like well no that's not even the tip of the iceberg there's so much more to it and it's not only this and all of that but it's one of the pieces that at this moment in time in our sort of early calculator phase or Abacus phase almost it's one of those things that that we're tackling but it's the wave that we're writing and I just can't wait until there's more accessibility and the learning Pathways to to end up the playgrounds to use all this yeah I mean I I totally agree with with all of that and I I think um it was it was nice to see the Jr in this syllabus that included um references to Eugenia Cheng's work because she's done a lot of great work to kind of make mathematics more accessible in this way um she had another article in the guardian like in the last week or so even talking about mathematics education and how um it's often like it often like scares people because they're ought to like you just apply algorithms in this kind of blind way to do like multiplication or calculus or whatever and and not really like play with the concepts in the way that I assigned to say okay well you know you're drawing these diagrams and you know you want to like play with them and it's it would be nice to see mathematics education take this kind of more playful root to start with one of the things that um Eugenia says in this article is that unfortunately that would make things kind of slower because like you just want people to you know muck around you don't want people just to you know be able to churn out this kind of computation but you know in this future where our computational tools are so powerful maybe we don't all need to be perfect integrators or like you know derivators and be able to like multiply numbers quickly and you know some people like doing long division but I I don't even remember how to see long division why would I it's it's it's silly to kind of drill that into children so they're happy in projects um to teach like kindergarten children um I like like a couple of projects not many some of the kind of Rules of This string diagrammatic stuff um in in this Quantum um information processing well this um of book Bob Cooker and his colleagues I think there was one um I'll check by Dan geeker in Birmingham and maybe one by Bob himself or at least he was trying to get it off the ground I don't remember um but at least where it has been tried I think they found that children very easily learn to use these these these kinds of languages um because it's just playing with pictures they're kind of much more approachable than this kind of scary symbolic language which is you know I don't I mean it it's a kind of fine language if you're used to like piping on a typewriter or like writing by hand where you're writing this linear way but you know if you go to like a mathematics department and look at the you know the whiteboards or the chalkboards there you know most of the time you see lots of pictures diagrams and things and that's how people reason typically um and so a lot of what's been happening with applied category theory is trying to like take using diagrams seriously as mathematics um and trying to like say okay well here's what we can do if we do if we do take it seriously we can sort of re-cap we've sort of recapitulate some of these things which people have found like abstract or abstruse or difficult in mathematics before and like make them seem a bit more easy to reason with now and so I mean that applies to like abstract things like stuff I've mentioned already like a Junctions like the laws of adjunctions you can draw them with think string diagrams I mean you know I haven't shown it in my thesis but like you can if you sort of Google around you can see you know adjunctions in a two category and they end up being some kind of sneaky picture and sort of you get a sense of like what's going on there from these pictures like the flow of information in some sense um and there's a similar thing with like with limonas the the joke for like functional programmers that they're monads is like oh like you don't know what a monad is well it's just a monoid in the category of endo functors and I I mean that's true it's not just a joke it's true but the thing is if you draw what a monoid is it's like a thing which like like one of these like you see on that picture you've got this Gauss thing and it's got a black dot and you've got you got one wire and then it has a black dot and then two wires come out of it and I said this is like copying well like a monoid is like that in the other direction like you've got two things that go into a dots and that come out with one thing so like when people say monoi they mean something like they often mean something like Edition you've got two numbers that come together and they produce one number or you've got like multiplication you've got two numbers again that come together and produce one number so like it's like the opposite of copying in some abstract sense which takes one thing and gives you two things this is something that takes two things and gives you one thing and so you can just like draw the the diagrams that Define a monoid and say okay well what does this mean for like Endo functions and you can sort of start to reason about it a bit more approachably I mean it's still quite abstract because it is quite abstract but it makes it kind of less scary to use this kind of language I think awesome yeah there's so much psychology and sociology in mathematics and just hearing about yeah on real chalkboards people branch and they flow and they Circle things and they put an X through something it's like there's all these operations that can't be copied with a typewriter and as are uh cyber physical and social niches develop and we have different affordances different metaphors different Quantum reference frames for working and being it starts to make more sense for uh having a natural language that can express that [Music] um yeah then I go and I said laser stuff it just makes me think of a touring tape where even if there is a linear representation it can still in some other way characterize like a lisp program with nesting or hierarchical model even though yes there's like a linearity but also there's a model so it's not that we can't represent certain things with the bit streams or anything like that it's just that that may be more like the Assembly Language and that when we actually want to do certain kinds of work we may want to just move lightly and semantically with a high level way to think about math yeah totally it's kind of it's notable to me that um like recently I mean I've been giving you know talks for a while you know using a computer whether or not like over Zoom but like it could be in person like you know have my like PowerPoint slides or whatever but these days if I give it a talk I just use my like top like digital tablet and I do everything like all the slides by hand and I draw pictures and it's nice now that we've got like technology that's starting to you know be a bit more human in that sense and I think this is like a kind of mathematical technology which is like that although I think it's also notable that um it's still in some sense quite Niche and I think I mean I don't I don't know but the impression I've got from talking to people is that it's still the case that some mathematicians sort of think of this kind of like mathematics of diagrams that somehow like not quite like real mathematics because it's like it's too much like play in some sense um but I think that I think that perspective is changing and people are taking it seriously I mean it is real work and there's a lot of hard problems um and you know stuff actually gets done but I think it's it doesn't to me it doesn't really matter what like a handful of mathematicians think it's just what's useful to people that matters um and so I mean I I hope that you know these tools continue to develop and like you know we can use them in all sorts of different domains um I don't know you know I've never really it's it's no it's like notable to me as well that like human Vision it's kind of like two and a bit dimensional really it's not really like three-dimensional but you've got a bit of three-dimensionality and I've never really played much with like three-dimensional diagrams but maybe I will one day have some tools with my like you know Vision Pro or less not pro thing or whatever it'll allow me to to do things even more like naturally like actually like plug together some stuff in some abstract space um who knows who knows yeah the diagram being two-dimensional or planar gives us this kind of classical screen holographic screen that information can be written on that then Quantum cognitive agents can unfold into the imaginary plane with the wick rotation but also the boundary just like you said earlier can come in many shapes many dimensionalities so we could have a four dimensional boundary artifact that still becomes rotated into a higher dimension and uh that's not the framing or the mathematics that most of us have learned up to this point there's a really crystallized would be a complementary way to say it but um codified or fossilized sedimentary understanding of math education its role in broader thinking and what we learn along the way and the progressions get reified with who makes it through the pipeline so I think that's like that's like the the unknown unknowns here the known unknowns like we all know that we struggle to understand this but then what but but then that's the real jumping off when it when it's not just us adapting into a new regime of learning and doing but when there's um composition and construction within that regime in our last um sections here um Dean or Ali another question or um what what do you looking to Bridge or Gap into the dot too Dean okay Elite please uh well yeah I actually I've written down a number of questions but uh they maybe um quite a specific and I think um they're perhaps best suited for the dot two discussion but I wanted to thank Toby for I mean I literally had goosebumps the entire time so uh it was really fascinating and uh quite enjoyable and I uh learned a lot and I hope to I I also have some additional questions in my mind I hope to uh get to get to some of them in the second discussion uh so yes thank you again it was really really great thanks Dean with the penultimate thoughts what do you um what do you see us heading into yeah well what if it's if it's okay I'd like just to read a really brief piece of the paper because I don't want to watch on Toby in the dot two without giving him a chance to think about this a bit under 7-4 you've got fundamental Theory and you say future work connected to this thesis need not only be in applications a number of purely theoretical questions raise themselves too and I love 741 this this one paragraph It's not it's it's for me I call it a really have to slow down and enjoy the moment you're today Toby I don't know if you're a distance Runner an endurance athlete of some kind but your stamina has been phenomenal but this one paragraph to me would be like a refreshment station where they offer you a milkshake and a piece of battered fish like it's yummy but you but you'd yeah you need to wait you have to pause and go I don't know if I want to do that but it really ties in nicely with the syntax stuff that Danny was talking about and I have a question at the end of it so I just want to read it though the mathematics of belief so you basically said belief is theoretical that's fantastic is in large part about replacing defense definite points with fuzzier distributions over them independent type Theory we've replaced points with terms non-dependent terms are exactly points so a type of theory with belief should somehow Encompass fuzzy terms just as we can replace points with distributions we can replace dependent points with the dependent distributions however the standard replacement moving from a category of functions to a category of stochastic channels obscures some of the universal categorical structure and underpins the rules of type Theory this standard replacement also misses something else while it does allow for fuzzy terms it omits a model of fuzzy types we might well want to express beliefs about things whose identity we are not quite sure and then you say in the next sentence there seems to be a couple of related resolutions to this puzzle my question for you is this and it's not for today it's maybe for next time um it seems to me we have to Grapple with this idea of making fuzzy clear and making fuzzy precise and you started speaking to that and my my Wonder of coming now with a strong a much stronger active inference set of priors is there has to be something more to this than just a gradient descent and I think you started to speak to that in this section and so um I'm kind of curious do you think that this is a feature the fact that we can do this we can do fuzzy clear and fuzzy precise and not necessarily see that as a contradiction but actually the way category Theory kind of gives us permission to examine that so again it doesn't have to be answered today and maybe I'm maybe I'm misinterpreting what you were trying to say there so I'm I'm open to being redirected but I just think that this opens up a world of possibilities and when I first read it um I I don't know like at least Goosebumps looked like but I was just I was just like oh man I really want to ask you about this so yeah I mean yeah I yeah so the thing about fuzzy type yeah so I do I gotta start by saying I agree the the kind of the what some of this is seeking is something like thinking clearly about thinking fuzzly in some ways kind of weird right um it's like having some certainty about uncertainty um but it's definitely the case that still now like I think a notion of like fuzzy type theory is not well developed though I am aware of people various people having thought about this and people thinking about it at the moment um and of course I've got my own ideas about it um but it seems natural right like we often think we know what I think like we can recognize a thing but like um maybe you're not quite sure and so like you know you're not sure if it's this or that or you see somebody coming down the street towards you and you can and recognize them as somebody you know or you used to know and then like as they approach that their identity becomes a bit clearer but you're not you know you weren't sure for a while um and I think you know there's nothing to say that you know we shouldn't be able to you know in some sense like types are a kind of elements of some bigger space and so we should be able to play all this math to it and it's kind of really about figuring out what the rules are that makes the kind of language of type Theory kind of align nicely with the language of probability um and it's a research effort but I'm happy to talk about it like more next time I'm also like happy to talk in any detail about any of the actual like specifics of the stuff in the material in the thesis or whatever else in category Theory you might be interested in like I'll probably be expert and everything of course but I mean I'm happy to try my best particularly if Ali it sounded like your questions were maybe of like a more technical nature maybe not if I I don't know if I got the right sense of what you were saying but if they are I'm happy to like talk about the details of that thank you sir I'd also like to like review any of the stuff like to to try to like say because I you're right that there's a lot of like detail in the thesis um because you know you make a flame and you're supposed to substantiate it and that means you have to give a proof and sometimes the proof is quite like complicated um but like structurally I'm I'm I want this to be simple or at least I have like a simple like framework and so I would like to be able to like clarify some of that if that's um if that's you know if there's time for that or if it comes to it yeah that sounds amazing in dot two we will uh return perhaps any questions that people submit as a comment on the video or as a message in the category Theory channel on our Discord we'll curate those questions wool re-watch and digest and then we can begin with Ali asking some um taking us on a little bit of a technical journey and Toby thanks again for the incredible work it's uh defined our 2023 in many ways so it's been a joy and we look forward to next week thanks for plowing through um I think yeah there's also the stuff I I think we talked about before that that we haven't really touched on this time and obviously I didn't read much in the pieces about like how do you actually fit in like action into this framework and like how do you like start to talk about this like multi-agent stuff we can you know your first time we can talk about all of that two of the pieces just to share that that gave us some of the most laughs were um first we didn't get action and and we're like it's I mean just the the the it wasn't an anti-climax it was a climax of its own and uh and then also we had had so many discussions over the months of time and the treatment of time backwards and forwards ringing the bell unringing the Bell um all of these different concepts and then in your limitations you said we we really have to work on getting a dynamical treatment oh yeah but I actually think that depending on like what you care about it may not be too hard so that's fine but even that you would say it that way just having dealt with time oh yeah yeah and then to be like well I mean it's like I thought that's what dynamical modeling was involving time no no so that that you're right you're totally right there so all I meant at that point was the the the kind of like statistical framework that I've been working with until then it just seems you have like a prior and like a way of make generating predictions but like the predict there's no like nothing to say that the prior has any like data about how stuff actually evolves in time or the predictions have any data about how like the since data evolves in time it's just like I believe that there's this on the screen and that makes there be this like stuff coming to my eye and that's it this is like a snapshot and so like when you want to include time evolution in those beliefs it Things become a bit more complicated awesome well thank you again Toby we'll see you um in a week and a day it's been a pleasure thank you for having me bye thank you so much bye
