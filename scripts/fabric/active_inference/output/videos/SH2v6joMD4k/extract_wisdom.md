# QUOTES:
- "We are a participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference."
- "The goal is to continue learning and discussing and unpacking this awesome paper."
- "The idea is if you receive some piece of data, you try to infer what's going on outside."
- "The brain would be encoding some kind of uncertainty."
- "There are plausible theories for how the brain would implement all of these things."
- "The free energy principle says that the brain is doing a variational base."
- "Ergodicity means that if you start your dynamic anywhere, it will sample the whole distribution."
- "Biological systems operate within homeostasis but it's a range."
- "We can use the same kind of math to model many kinds of things."
- "The mean firing rate of a neural population would encode the posterior estimates."
- "The idea of homeostasis is really the steady state assumption."
- "Exploration and curiosity are really something that characterize intelligent systems."
- "Information geometry enables you to quantify how two beliefs are different from each other."
- "The dynamics that we're considering are extremely general."
- "Thereâ€™s a lot of literature about one of the fundamental things of being alive."
- "The statistical manifold is the mathematical object that says these are all the beliefs."
