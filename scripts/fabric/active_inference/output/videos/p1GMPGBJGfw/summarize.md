# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The presentation explores active inference through string diagrams, advocating for a formal, diagrammatic approach using category theory to enhance understanding.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Sean Tull presents active inference using string diagrams based on category theory.
2. Active inference models cognition from organisms to single neurons, minimizing free energy.
3. String diagrams provide a graphical language for active inference, enhancing clarity and accessibility.
4. The presentation emphasizes the importance of formalization to aid understanding and application.
5. Category theory aids in describing generative models and their interactions within active inference.
6. The framework allows for compositional intelligence, connecting different cognitive theories and models.
7. Bayesian updating is discussed, differentiating between sharp and soft observations.
8. Free energy principles are explored, including variational and expected free energy.
9. The need for a compositional approach to free energy across different levels of systems is highlighted.
10. Future directions include connecting category theory with artificial intelligence and consciousness studies.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. String diagrams enhance the representation and understanding of active inference.
2. A formalized approach using category theory can unify diverse cognitive theories.
3. The distinction between sharp and soft observations is crucial for Bayesian updating.
4. Free energy serves as a central concept in active inference and cognition.
5. Future research can bridge gaps between cognitive science, physics, and artificial intelligence.
