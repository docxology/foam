# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter 6 discusses the differences between high road and low road approaches in active inference modeling and their implications.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. High road focuses on fundamental questions and existential properties of agents.
2. Low road builds generative models starting from existing mental frameworks.
3. Active inference connects the free energy principle to modeling behavior.
4. Markov blankets define statistical boundaries separating agents from their environments.
5. Different scales of Markov blankets can represent varying cognitive levels.
6. Generative models require specifying actions, hidden states, and sensory mappings.
7. The process of modeling involves a sequence of questions guiding development.
8. Bayesian mechanics links statistical principles to free energy in active inference.
9. The distinction between generative models and processes can be blurred.
10. Active inference modeling can simulate complex behaviors in multi-agent systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding high and low road approaches aids in effective modeling strategies.
2. Markov blankets are essential for defining agent-environment relationships in models.
3. Constructing generative models involves careful consideration of actions and states.
4. Collaboration in coding and modeling enhances learning and exploration of concepts.
5. Degrees of freedom in modeling relate to the boundaries perceived by agents.
