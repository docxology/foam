# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The active inference tutorial stream discusses modeling behavioral tasks through generative models to explore decision-making, learning, and neurobiological interpretations.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference aims to model empirical data for better understanding of decision-making processes.
2. Participants can use generative models to analyze behavior in psychological and neuroscience research.
3. The active inference framework includes parameters for reward, preference, and learning rates.
4. Participants can learn to set up models for tasks like perceptual decision-making and reinforcement learning.
5. The framework helps researchers identify differences in behavior between clinical and healthy populations.
6. Generative models can estimate hidden states and their influences on observed outcomes.
7. Bayesian updating allows for dynamic adjustments based on new information and prior beliefs.
8. The tutorial provides practical examples for setting up tasks and interpreting results in research.
9. Understanding neural correlates of active inference parameters enhances insights into brain function.
10. Future sessions will focus on coding implementation and advanced applications of active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference integrates perception, learning, and decision-making through structured generative models.
2. Understanding hidden states enhances the interpretation of behavioral data in neuroscience.
3. Bayesian methods offer a robust framework for modeling uncertainty and learning dynamics.
4. The tutorial series aims to make active inference accessible for researchers at various experience levels.
5. Practical coding examples will facilitate hands-on learning and application of active inference techniques.
