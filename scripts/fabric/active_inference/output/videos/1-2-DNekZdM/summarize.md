# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The meeting discussed the transition from the first half of a textbook on active inference to its practical applications in the second half.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The meeting focused on reviewing the transition between the first and second halves of the textbook.
2. Participants shared their experiences with active learning since the last meeting.
3. The second half of the textbook emphasizes practical applications of active inference modeling.
4. The structure of chapters in the textbook varies significantly between the first and second halves.
5. Chapter six introduces a four-step recipe for designing active inference models.
6. The importance of questions and discourse for improving understanding was highlighted.
7. There is a focus on generative models and their applications in neurobiology in earlier chapters.
8. Future meetings will include live discussions with experts to clarify concepts.
9. Participants are encouraged to contribute insights and questions to enhance learning.
10. The session ended with plans for upcoming activities and discussions in the cohort.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Transitioning to practical applications is crucial for understanding active inference.
2. Engaging in discussions enhances collective learning and model development.
3. Chapter six's four-step recipe is a key focus for upcoming sessions.
4. Continuous feedback and questioning improve the discourse around complex topics.
5. Collaboration on code and modeling practices is encouraged within the cohort.
