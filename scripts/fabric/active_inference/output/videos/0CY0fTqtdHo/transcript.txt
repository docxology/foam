all right hello and welcome everyone it's November 21st 2023 we're here in active live stream number 56.2 discussing a quartet of papers with Alex aoria this is the third discussion we've had we had a DOT zero giving some background and context we hello welcome everyone it's November 2th 20 that Alexander you're inactive live stream empirical demonstration of the feedback delay of live streaming so let's just jump in perhaps blue if you have any initial kind of remarks or questions then to Alex and also if anyone's watching live they can of course write a question and I'll check it out so go for it blue and we'll just jump in so for me today I think I am really excited to get into um the cognitive model so like the last paper was my favorite and it was um I think maybe like the most zoomed out so I'm really kind of looking forward in to getting into that and then um maybe exploring what that would look like um in a non-human system so that's I mean I kind of always want to go there but I'm still I still want to go there cool what figure should we jump to or or what part of the paper should we jump to Alex um I mean whichever one caught I think yours in Blue's interest I guess we could go to the architecture one oh I do want to if you don't mind a tiny Shameless plug that I just want to take the moment right now I'm gonna post this link in the chat because it relates to our conversation we had in point one um so this is a paper that just came out the end of last week um I just want to add that as context ization especially blue you might find it interesting because uh this was work I've worked on I think I even alluded to it over like the last seven months um this is why I was talking about inactive and embodied cognition uh and uh there's a lot more so now now it's out there I don't have to pretend like oh it's a secret project um that was it so that's my only Shameless plug let's go back I just I thought I should start with this so the the um the not to steal the Thunders of 56.1 were this paper that came out in the time between yeah it literally came out last end of last week yeah wow so I mean maybe just while we're here like could you just you don't have to review it I've already had so you already have so many papers but it might be worth yeah like could you just give us like the ele elevator pitch about this paper and um like maybe your favorite figure because I mean we were really excited your comments last week okay so scroll up Daniel uh it's it's actually early there's there's cool stuff but go to the yeah it's a very long paper yeah that picture it has it also has an appendix or a supplement but so it was a longer original paper too uh just that way again I don't steal the Thunder of this particular podcast because our Focus was different um now the the general idea is uh my my thesis are Carl and my cist thesis is about moral computation which is a phrase that Jeffrey Hinton introduced uh very briefly like in about like two sentences or a small paragraph in his paper in December uh and I have written at length about it in a couple of my own papers end of December of last year in January and February um so this is sort of like uh the big uh Deep dive into what does it mean to make a computer that is not Immortal which is what we have in computer science today uh the computer is inextricably bound or rather the software is inextricably bound to the hardware uh sorry not bound to the hardware I'm just making a mistake there so for example we can copy our software or machine intelligence program across any amount of computers and it doesn't really matter um and uh it's also extremely inefficient and then the opposite side of that is Mortal computation which is essentially drawing inspiration from life itself uh for example uh when any one of us dies a human dies uh your computations your memories your quirks the things that define who you are are essentially gone right because it's Unique to you and that is because you're an embodied in active agent um and so what's kind of nice about this diagram is it's it's a really colorful pretty diagram but it's in it sort of synthesizes two out of the three perspectives in this paper so uh Carl and I investigated biophysics uh which is sort of like the intersection of physics physiology biology chemistry and the ideas that have echoed over I mean essentially the last century and that's the top half the bottom half is a classical and very interesting domain called cybernetics which is like the intersection of uh computer science control theory also physics and a bunch of other domains and information Theory and it also has similar ideas and everything centers around this idea of homeostasis and all the millions of uh variations and higher order uh you know uh Concepts that build on that in the ideas that uh our intelligence and uh essentially is driven by our our per desire to persist and to survive in an environment and so this actually takes my comments from the last point1 podcast with you guys uh to its natural conclusion which is I don't just believe you need a body you need an environment you need essentially a drive to persist and to fight uh thermodynamic disolution or dissipation into the environment or disintegration is a better word um so we are essentially a in the biological second law of Thermodynamics which is why it's also about free energy uh and so then uh we and then there's another but it's also that it's a later diagram cognitive science and uh Carl and I uh propose 5e cognitive theory which is just taking the classical 4E Theory um I don't remember if I said this too last time but embedded uh extended uh inactive and uh you know the and uh yeah embedded oh embodied foure the traditional four e we added something called Elementary cognition which I did say to you guys basil cognition last time so this kind of like ties these three areas together as well as the philosophy of life and death and ex existentialism and kind of combines them together into a unified framework and then uh we we dive into marot blankets I I I think they're a beautiful and elegant formal ISM for tying these ideas together and getting us a step towards uh you know the Mortal computation mortal computer design and then we we we talk about the free energy principle underpinnings that essentially the the Mortal uh computer and bodies and we review uh a couple of existing mortal computers which do exist so organoids or micro physiological intelligence is a beautiful example of this uh even uh we talk about fungal computers also Michael Levens work on xenobots so we have like a nice little table and then there's an appendix with a little bit of expansion on that also we have to give credit to uh Ashby uh who's a really well-known and or uh very important cybernetical scientist cyber cybernetic cybernetician um and his homeostat which is also an example of an insilico model computer so long story short uh we if we want One path to artificial general intelligence is not going to be the way we have it now uh it's not through just bigger and bigger Transformers which are extremely energy efficient they're labeled in the domain of AI itself red AI if we want green AI we want Edge Computing we want neuro robots uh that are also able to do humanlike actions and enact in humanlike Behavior Uh because we think for example the human model or even animal models right are a good template for how we can interact and engage in our environment um then the idea is that we need to transition to this idea of mortal computation and leave behind my last Point here uh the tool oriented view of artificial general intelligence because the way we treat AGI today and we say this towards the end of the paper um that while it's very important important and very helpful for Humanity uh to build artificial intelligence systems that are very very narrow and very tool Centric they are more to support something for a particular task if we want to build general intelligence uh then uh Carl and I put forth the moral computation thesis as one possible pathway uh to go into the future so this is sort of also a call for researchers across all these different domains to come together ranging from biophysics to biology to computer science and machine learning uh to computational Neuroscience cognitive science it's pretty much and cybernetics of course all of them kind of converging to perhaps build uh a different Pathway to what we call the Mortal computer and so I think that wasn't quite a good elevator pitch that was a little bit longer but I'm G to stop there because I think then you can just read the paper it's it's it's fun well it's a tall elevator there's a lot of floors in the bunker um I think there's a perfect articulation there 56.2 let's focus on living functioning cognitive Frameworks but it's really cool that you're going into the life and death elements that way so I do think that the paper that blue wants to talk about there's a compliment to to it because we do mention very briefly in this paper cognitive architectures like the common and also the common model of cognition blueprint that we also talked about in01 which is the center basis for the paper that uh blue was going to ask some questions about I think uh it's mentioned here briefly and that we also talked about as that being uh a potential maybe we don't say it this way I said it in conversation to someone but a a a CO an inductive bias which you did right you wrot basis I also talk about it as like the idea of cognitive architecture and modules of Mind serve sort of like as a prior and that is uh produced by Evolution and uh we also talk in the paper too the moral Computing paper evolution is important natural selection is an important ingredient uh and if we don't use that uh then we have to design the results of evolution so I think the common model of cognition which can help segue into the paper now um is a beautiful bias it is one of our Best Bets for how do we emulate the modules of mind and how things interact um and this would get at the the neural computation component of a mortal computer obviously it does not say anything about the body about the niche about other agents but you know you can imagine it is a little block that would go into this framework and that would be one step towards a mortal computer so so can I just temporarily derail I just have to ask a followup question I have to ask my fault for derailing at the beginning I um so just in terms when you're when you're talking about Mortal Computing I mean I just couldn't help but go to Quantum Computing where the computation itself is so heavily dependent on the substrate and the modality of the hardware right like the the computation the hardware and the computation are like really inextricably linked there um and and in the same way that like you know I can write a paper you can write a paper all of these things will Outlast us like so some of our computations Will Survive Beyond like the point where we're biologically dead right so in a quantum computer similarly all of those computations can then be taken and translated and put into Python and all all of the things right um but I just wonder to what um extent and like I know I kind of know where quantum computers and artificial intelligence like meet you know like everything's got to go into the Cubo and then the answer comes out and so then we take the answer and put it back into Python and do regular AI things with it or in some language right not always python but sometimes right so where do you think can a quantum computer or can we ever get Quantum computation or what is the role of quantum computation how can that intermingle with artificial intelligence and then become a mortal computer or is that just like too farfetched we're not going to think about that well so the paper doesn't go into that specifically however we touch on a little bit because uh a little bit of the paper and we we cite it plenty uh Carl's work with Chris fields which I know he's been on you guys have been doing a series with him on Quantum Computing Quantum information Theory um he had a paper neuromorphic Computing induces the free energy principle or some version of that title I read that many times as well and in there I think is the way that Quantum Computing or Quantum information Theory would interact with the Mortal computer and so I don't see I see it as another perspective there could have been a fourth perspective in this already long paper um and I did originally have some ambition to write something about that and we distilled it to just the concept that Chris Fields introduces which was the interface so I think the quantum information theoretic interpretation of the brain and the body especially like as presented in that paper and related work could be a better way to deal with the Markoff blanket formalism that uh Carl and I uh constructed in this paper this paper uh which is largely grounded by also my educational back ground too because I only have uh you know some moderate knowledge in you know quantum mechanics uh and it was a while since I studied that but um in there we are treating the paper is like a classical interpretation or you could say almost the Newtonian interpretation of the free energy principle and uh and Carl and I discussed this many times as we were working on this paper um that that has a limitation it's not necessarily that you can't build them more I think this paper gives you all the the foundation you need to literally build a mortal computer get started it's a like a theoretical mathematical conceptualization however um there are some weird things about the thermodynamic energy exchange between the internal states of your agent your entity and the environment and originally I had a different diagram of the Markov blanket so that there is later in the paper you'll see it I really like that diagram because it really made yeah you probably saw it it was there towards the end it looked like a spider almost um yeah that so this originally had a different version where I had these uh extra States uh because I like to take old Concepts and extend them myself and I had these thermodynamic States in there and I had them tried and I had probabilistic arcs that wir them all these arcs are designed carefully to make sure that it aderes to the mark of blanket principles of like you know the dependency relationships between children and parents and the children of children or the children of parents um and how they relate together so I had embedded extra States and Carl said that I should remove those because it's uh it violates the classical interpretation of the free energy principle and long story short is that you have this energy Exchange in the diagram and you can represent that is dissipation but it's not a state that the agent would have like access to in the marov blanket so now back to the Chris Fields interpretation if you go to the interface uh I think he calls it like a Quantum interface he had a or um he had a name for it it has like this really fancy symbol in the in the paper um if you use that you get access it's not like you have access to manipulate it but you can sort of perceive it from the perspective of the agent you see the sensory and the action state so so the the partitions of that field um and I'm probably B butchering his language Chris's language but and then you also have like the thermodynamic exchange portion or partition of that field uh and like it's like a the non-manipulable and manipulable portions of it and so I think that interpretation could be a more powerful way to like you said blue earlier that Quantum information Theory and Quantum uh sorry quantum information theoretic and Quantum Computing interpretations lend themselves to that natural entanglement that this that this paper uh takes from so again we surveyed work all the way back to decart uh in Emanuel con but you know and tying all their ideas together because by the way even though we're putting forth the phrase mortal computation the Mortal computation thesis uh and trying to essentially EST established that as our foundation for all of science to build on uh it's kind of been echoed Brilliant Minds thinkers theoreticians Engineers have existed forever so uh it's kind of like a synthesis and unification of already wonderful ideas across vast parts of all the domains um but I think the quantum information theoretic way could be the next step the fourth perspective to Quantum Computing and it could lend itself to maybe easier impementation especially if you have access to a quantum computer obviously this is the joke we had last time uh when we talked about Evolution and why I specifically might not directly work in that although I have some work in genetic algorithms and neuro evolutionary with uh Travis desel who was on here for the ant colony optimization work that was presented um it's compute right I don't have access to the quantum computers of our time or maybe the simulator and of course the knowledge to perhaps use that effectively however I think that someone who does could perhaps take the principles that are put forth here take the Chris Fields uh interface interpretation and he goes into a lot more detail like he talks about he had something called like a tdnn or something it was like the quantum neural network and they were trying to come up with the morphology but the uh the principles there are echoed in some sense here too we that work but um obviously but uh Carl's on there too but the the the principles of morphology uh which are like essentially we originally had another word in the title called morphic uh because the idea is that intelligence should ultimately you can't divorce it from any form of instantiation you got to choose something you're GNA be brittle but you're going to be thermodynamically efficient and I think if you could interpret it from that perspective the quantum information theoretic that might lend itself to a more powerful implementation uh the last comment I'll make and I'm already long-winded on this so the final point is we do also briefly mention in the conclusion of this paper and we haven't even talked about the papers that uh we wanted to about today but in the conclusion uh I also mentioned Quantum Computing but in a weird way so I hope it doesn't feel too contradictory to that I just said that if you take the quantum information theoretic interpretation of mortal Computing or build your own interpretation because we don't really do it much for you here except mention the the the interface um while that could be a powerful and perhaps the best way who knows to implement it we also mentioned Quantum computation as sort of like okay others have been looking at this in Ai and for example saying like we can do if we have a properly developed uh quantum computer we can do big root Force search right we can do simulated and kneeling faster than our minds ever could have conceived with classic comple that's kind of just been in what's we can do machine learning better um and we we sort of argue a little tiny bit against it uh not against the interpretation but rather the the fact that Quantum Computing plus machine learning is just another way to do what we currently do which is narrow AI Brute Force search better and faster and so that's essentially it keeps live Immortal computation right because what are we going to probably do I I I'm not a not pretending to be a Seer I'm not pretending to predict the future there's no way I can know of all people but um the way we're going about it is that oh we're gonna try to put chat GPT or some Transformer like model in a quantum computer and yeah it's going to work a lot faster it might be more efficient but at the end of the day we're going to be programming that quantum computer at a separation level right we're going to try try to deal with it like we do in a normal operating system maybe we all have to learn a little quantum mechanics to do it um and we write our code and we write our software and then we just hope that the quantum computer can execute it really fast that's not the premise that I would want a quantum computer to be used that's still Immortal computation just done in an accelerated faster way so we do warn or rather are rather even just more like slightly common that while Quantum Computing will be important and uh we there is uh promise there to even speed up the computations we do today it's not necessarily its current use or the way we sort of project to use it is not the right path to AGI either so or biomimic intelligence which is really what the paper's trying to say if we want to build biomimic AGI maybe there's other types of AGI and I don't mean like animal because animals are definitely a part of this paper uh organism anything that maintains homeostasis to some level that's what this paper says is the the pathway to that style of AGI there might be something else again I don't want to comment on whether or not uh large language models and Transformers and these new architectures there might be something alien that I can't foresee and maybe Quantum Computing will make that uh you know more energy efficient and some way or faster it's still going to carry forward though the premise of tool-based I and uh you know AI uh in the way that we do it narrow AI I don't think it's going to lend itself to the path that we would really want general intelligence and general intelligence really is tied uh at least if we use organisms as our exemplars tied to the fact that we we don't have forever right uh that we we know to some degree whether we're conscious or unconsciously aware of the fact that I am at odds with my environment I'm going to behave in this way in service of that and of course Evolution uh encodes some of that knowledge going into it um so I just want to comment that I I think that it's it depends on how you use the quantum perspective like if you use it from like the Chris Field's Quantum information theoretic interpretation of the markup blanket that might be a really excellent way for someone to even follow up on this and add the fourth perspective that Carl and I kind of just dance around a little bit or an mation I think there could be some really fascinating things here but if you're just using Quantum Computing uh to accelerate your normal run current day machine learning the current approaches that we have uh then you're just still carrying forward the banner of immortal computation and again too I want to make one last comment just because we talked about it um this paper says we need Mortal computation and uh it was weird there isn't uh much more than Jeff's one mention of it in his 2022 Ford Ford learning paper then my paper had a little bit longer section the predictive Ford Ford algorithm and then I had the spiking version of the Ford Ford the the pioneered that idea and we had like an introduction like about a page about Mortal computation and then there's this one with Carl which is you know a really really long uh doozy of a paper um so aside from that I've only seen mortal computation sort of discussed oh I see a little bit of Mortal Kombat appearing um I see discussions like brief mentions of mortal computation but there was something that Jeff mentioned somewhere along the line or maybe it was an interpretation of it I don't also think mortal computation should completely replace Immortal computation I think both have a place in society we just need to understand that they both do different things and they both have different purposes if we want you know intelligent agents and neuro robots I'm on the camp you need Mortal computation to do it right but uh if we want that type of General Behavior but Immortal computation is not going to go away it's just more like we understand it has a very high thermodynamic cost because we have to deal with the Von noyman bottleneck the memory bottleneck we're not using in memory processing um maybe a Quantum Computing will speed that up too and then Immortal computation can live side by side and we'll have those as tools so I also want to make that clear for anyone that ever watches you know this recording later uh that the Mortal computation thesis isn't to say it's the only way to do computation it's just we should shake up the roots of computer science at its foundation and say maybe there's another way to do it and we should have both live side by side and hey this one might lend itself to AGI um which by the way some people might disagree with that as well I don't again I we do offer it very humbly in the paper as one possible pathway not the because again I could be completely wrong there could be a better way to do this but um yeah so well that was a really good answer and you really articulated like what I was trying to ask about and I think um it's actually really easy to get access to a quantum computer but it's not it's really easy to get access to the interface to a quantum computer and I think that what you what you keyed in on is like you need the morphology you need the structure like so in order to play with a quantum computer and program the quantum computer to do Mortal computation you actually have to play with the substrate itself and not just have access to the computer through some interface Network right yep bingo bingo to kind of bring us towards the nonhuman cognitive modeling sl4 paper something coming up in that was all the different ways that we talk about interface and also the different ways we represent it like this is really creative and I've never seen the um blanket represented this way with a with a Zone and which connects nicely to the the blanket index but whether we're talking about the kind of strict analytical Bas graph Markov blanket or the quantum interface or just an engineering interface input output or flow diagram systems Dynamics or the the kind of perhaps most general or accounting system of them all like applied category Theory we're describing these different facets of the interface so that's one place to begin when modeling a non-human or a human cognitive architecture is its interfaces it's like if those aren't accounted for we're either speculating information that we're measuring or observing or interacting with this cognitive thing rather speculating about what we could do or about what we could measure or we're missing things that we actually can intervene with and measure so maybe how do we go about before even wondering about which formalism it's going to be described as how do we think about the interface of a cognitive system that's yeah well you just brought up a really good point I just want to point out that you said uh if we don't design you know the interface between let's say the internal states of the agent which just to connect it to the cognitive modeling paper you could think of the common model of cognition as the design of the internal States right it's the brain right and uh let's just keep it like the organization or principles of the brain because again I think of CMC common model of cognition as a blueprint and you know Cog engine which is what that paper is about is a physical well it is a computational instantiation of some pieces of CMC um and even that is still only a part of the puzzle so but you could think of that that's going to be what's inside the Markoff blanket all right uh and then of course inside of it could be more Markoff blankets because we also talk about markup blankets of markup blankets of markof blankets and there's a recursive assembly kind of but uh you brought up Daniel if you don't design uh it could also be an engineered you know uh permeable boundary with pumps and things that you know for example remove toxins from the internals of the agent and brings in nutrients and energy which we do talk about as well in the in the Mortal computation paper um regardless of the formalism you're all if you don't account for it and you don't so while Cog engine does not account for it it's still one of those like well we're going to just say we're looking at some very very specific internal States and we're going to probe it in a very specific way although we kind of have an agent because we do use the gym minig grid so there is a body but it's like a really really really simplified body uh you're missing out on a lot of intelligence and cognition that the boundary itself will give you so even in cells right so this is to take what you said Daniel and you know Jack uh boost it even higher the boost the signal uh is that I also believe a lot of the intelligent computations that we do can be are offloaded right this is the embodiment thesis of cognitive science the the even the permeable cell boundary right of just single cell organisms or multicellular organisms uh it does a lot of beautiful things that the internal states are not doing like uh consciously or directly with effort may actually should be careful with Consciousness at different levels but um the that boundary the mark of blanket offloads some of that compute that the brain or the internal States need to worry about um and it can they can sort of rely on what the boundary does now of course there's more to that story that even the Markov blanket doesn't necessarily need to address it U but there's the fact that there's also autop pesis so the ideas that the system reproduces it's self- reproducing that's where why there's a lot more it's a paper that very much is like an iceberg you can read the beginning and be like that's a beautiful phrase and then what's underneath it is this extremely deep and I don't even think I Carl and I have properly even captured all the facets that you could add to this there's more like we just talked about the quantum interpretations as well um so assuming that we have everything taken care of that things self-heal self-repair uh the the boundary itself is in you know constant reconstruction uh you you have this nice power or nice advantage that you not only account for how energy flows in and out of the system and things that you would normally not account for in our traditional agents that we design today um but you would also have the ability to offload cognition there's even a domain we mention it in the paper too but uh you might have heard of morphological robotics um and there's even classical ideas going back to even I believe even Rodney Brooks mentioned aspects of this as well in some of his early work uh if you study the way that we move our joints and our arms uh you know there's a lot of uh cognition offloaded into that act and you can also get that in terms of Robotics too and just saying by understanding the you know kinematics that drive an arm now the robotic brain if you will the neuro robot only needs to say I need to move my hand to this point and then it can sort of trust its digital nervous system or rather the actual constructs in the robotic Hardware to move the rest of the arm like he doesn't have to think consciously about moving the elbow just needs to move the point if you know from computer Graphics inverse kinematics right you only need to move the point of the hand to where you want to go and then the rest takes care of the mo motion and it looks you know it doesn't break the constraints of how like the bones are structured and the SK little structure of the Armature of the character so uh I think you there's even more to just model not just mod so we do talk about modeling too because some of us or a lot of us might not have access to the hardware as well right I think it's in the appendix I think it had to be moved to the supplement of the paper because it was already very long oh yeah it is in the supplement but we have this problem called the body Niche problem uh and besides the fact it's a nice sounding philosophical problem there's this issue that uh robotic Hardware or even organoid you know constructs or biological substrates or CH won't be available to everyone so if we want to democratize things we're going to probably need to model these digitally and so we have this concept called a digital morphology so maybe we can take whatever principles of physics and other aspects of thermodynamics maybe we can construct bodies that we can simulate for cheap so people can work on Mortal computers simulated right uh although the ultimate would be you just like blue brought up earlier about the best way to use a a quantum computer would be to literally have access to the quantum computer and then design your internal States your software that would run run it uh literally on chip right or on on quantum computer whatever the right word for that would be but they're entangled so you're completely uh you're only paying the cost the thermodynamic cost of reading and writing to the memory right on the chips or right on the actual platform itself uh rather than having these separations right even including like operating systems and the transfer of memory and a hierarchy and so having the actual Hardware would be the best and I think that's where you know even the work kind of says this is where the future really lies but probably along the way we could probably work with digital morphologies as well so long answer but just to say that your point is great and we could boost it even further by offloading cognition to the body and I also think because you said what formalism would you choose and I don't think any one formalism is you know like Superior per se they give you different things I think the mark of blanket is nice because it connects to uh beian probability and then you can kind of at least characterize the relationships between states um but from an engineering point of view I don't think you like directly have to design the exact markup blanket because now you're dealing with a graphical model and what would you what do we usually do we usually choose discret States and the world's continuous I thought about this like I thought okay now that this paper has come out how do I build my own mortal computer right just to show how we could do this uh but you know I think Michael Levan has a great example uh with the xenobots like that's one way to do it although it's very biological artificial um but I think just designing boundaries and sort of clearly explaining or accounting for the thermodynamic exchange and understanding like what are the resources that we have at hand even in a very controlled environment might be the way to design the Markov blanket because then you get for free if you have like and I think we talked last time about like a quadr ped orur a robot like spot or something and you know have it outside right if you already choose your body and you put it in an environment you've already now dealt with the boundary and the niche you just need to understand the properties of that which is where we can Leverage The the wonderful knowledge across domains like physics and biology and chemistry understand the properties of that body right understand the properties of that Niche and then all we have to work on is the internal State Design and how does that interact with maintaining persistence right for example battery level power level that's a homeostatic variable or a metabolic variable there you go now you can build your agent about keeping that variable uh in within a certain range right because homeostasis is about a set point so may have a Target or actually the we changed the word to something more powerful homeorhesis which is homeostasis over time right because set points might change like in flux to the environment um so that's that's a kind of a cool concept as well there's like a word for everything I learned when writing this paper so many Concepts already exist all we have to do is just stitch them together and this is one way to stitch them together into a nice little framework um so did that make sense yeah I'll I'll make a note and then blue I'll be curious to see what you think about this I think with what you've just described you you've almost given some of the most specific ways to think about what is off loadable we've talked about extended cognition and about having passive artifacts in the niche like paper and pen and then having active artifacts in the niche like autonomous agents or whether they're material or or just digitalized so it's interesting that by putting certain computation on the boundary or on the interface broadly conceived with both a material thermodynamic and a informational semantic component then it's like yeah the nucleus doesn't decide about the cell morphology and so it's like how many layers can you put in between in between so that the computation goes out to the interfaces everywhere's an interface from somewhere and that's where the work is really done and then there's just so many other great points but what do you think about this kind of conclusion to 2023 live streams after long arcs with thinking about embod cognition and cognitive architectures um so wow what is off loadable uh I I have a lot to say about that um uh so like in terms of what the body does um and let me know if my internet cuts out and I'll shut my video off um but in terms of what the body does like it's like you think about things that are automatic right like the heartbeat and the breath um and and stuff that like we just ignore and like I mean if you really you could do biof feedback and slow your heart heart rate and like breathing you can definitely control I mean it's very obvious that you can control it um but but like I wonder about these things like what is offloaded to the body that we're ignoring right like if you offload too much you know like we have like gut reactions to like like you know these like Sensations and there's like a lot of computation happening within our own morphological structure that maybe we're not conscious of like so a lot of is unconscious but then like are we overlooking stuff that we should then be paying attention to like I like I wonder what is the price of of offloading that's a great question um I mean I don't know to be fair I can't say I know the exact sweet spot because that would also mean that I have uh the exact instantiation of the Mortal computer that I wish to build right um you know the answer is we need to study that uh that's the short answer the slightly longer answer how do I say this without letting myself ramble well so maybe there is a point where we cross where we had let's say humans animals even any any entity has failed to find The Sweet Spot like you just said blue uh even we humans when we do something you know we have a gut reaction and we might tend to listen to that gut reaction rather than doing some other type of processing like thinking critically or logically and counteracting it we also have emotions which I think is very important which we don't really quite have that uh in today's AI but uh we do kind of have a little bit of some good work has been done in cognitive science and cognitive architectures but I think that we might have already crossed the sweet spot because some of us listen more to our guts and our emotions than logical logic or reasoning or you know planning things out more carefully or listing pros and cons some of us might not listen enough to our gut feelings and we listen too much so I think the diversity uh in even within any entity such as a human is vast and so maybe someone has the optimal sweet spot I don't know who does it varies but it doesn't matter so it's kind of interesting we it's it's an interesting question to quantify and worth looking at but at the same time in designing a mortal computer let's say I failed to design the one that has the right balance let's say I designed a computer that mortal computer that leaned more heavily towards gut reactions uh than not well I would still be thrilled that we built such a computer because while it would be great to find and characterize these set points or sorry these boundaries and regions um we would still have the premise that look life is built on these hierarchical or rather layers of complexity so homeostasis homeo sorry homeorhesis and homeostasis which sit at sort of the bottom of what we talk about in the paper um and then underneath that are like got to be careful a little bit but they're like metabolic pathways or what we or Carl and I call Essential Primitives or variables which are kind of like the materials and the the very based constructs that maybe we you know manipulate to survive with but above that are things like allostasis and complex processing and of course we put at the top of our hierarchy autop pesis but technically uh the idea is that everything would be self-repairing and healing but if we put the growth and dynamic change aside for just a minute our allostasis can be argu and it has been argue to be all kinds of things it can be uh oh we have little neural circuits that try to uh predict when homeostatic processes are going to need resources and so this is where you can see it in animals and uh insects and other types of uh creatures that oh I know that uh the seasons are going to change like Birds they fly to another and they so they have these kind of instincts built in or they have some sensors in circuit processing to say I should probably go somewhere else where I'm not going to Die For the Win turn so then they flock away right or they fly away so there's already some higher level Behavior built on there the reason I bring up that just to tie it back to that balance point that you bring blue is that we would have the opportunity to design those neural processes that could override for example your gut reaction or your more primitive instincts and so this is what's kind of nice about the Mortal computer is we would want that ability to do planning to do higher level thinking and this is again what connects nicely to the cognitive architecture right if we have a more developed let's say brain region area right we have different types of memory like procedural declarative memory um now we're able to start to think at a higher level that's not just purely driven by our instincts and so the 5D cognitive theory uh in the paper Elementary cognition I don't think is the only thing you need that would be like I only rely on my gut instincts I am primitive in the sense Primal I only want to live and I will do whatever it takes to live but for example if you live in a society of mortal computers which is one way you could think of humans I'm not going to start calling my friends Mortal computers but we live in a in a relationship we have a we are complex system and ourselves well now we're not just only thinking about uh exactly like I I don't want to die right now right because if that's how we live then you know we go back to uh kill or be killed law of the Jungle right we are just sort of fighting amongst each other so I think while it's hard to answer what's The Sweet Spot or the balance point I would still think having a mortal computer that even has the ability to engender those Primal gut instincts would be very powerful and then we could work on thinking well what are the right neural processes to counteract that right to add the critical logical thinking what constructs would have Evolution evolved to allow us to counteract that um does that make sense because I think like it's almost like it's a good question to ask but I don't think it's uh it's more like it would be OD it would be profound if we had something that leaned a little too heavily on its gut instinct and we say okay but now we have these allostatic processes we're just missing more of that higher level be Behavior to counteract that uh because we humans are able to for example ignore even sometimes our Primal needs our desire not maybe completely desire to persist because some of that's very deep low level um but like we even have the act of like heroism right you know like I'm gonna go save someone that I care about and that will end your persistence you will thermodynamically disintegrate when you know I go into the fire right so we have these higher level cognitive processes we're going to need to design those too or let some evolutionary process let those emerge so um I would still we just don't have the low level either and we we might not have the full picture of the higher level but right now a lot of artificial intelligence doesn't even have that that Primal persistence right so I I think I would be thrilled to have that problem and say oh blue it's a little too survival oriented maybe we could try to uh introduce the right mechanisms to counterbalance that that's another thought so I just am rereading a book by um the theoretical physicist Fred Allen wolf and he talks about um like literally in terms of quantum entanglement he talks about the entanglement of thought and emotion which I think like thinking about Quantum Computing and quantum entanglement like the entanglement between thought and emotion is just like a really interesting concept to me or just an interesting way to think about like who wins or like can you have one without the other or one always knows what the other one is doing or yeah and the problem we have in I agree we have that entanglement and is fascinating the problem in uh artificial systems or technological artifacts which by the way another theme of this paper and we sort to wrap it up is it's like a path to it's going to sound a little odd artificial sentience and then that also opens up the whole moral uh issues and ethical dilemmas but um but to even get there I would argue we're missing the half of your entanglement right we're missing more the emotional side which I think also stems from you know even the lower level processes that kind of give rise to the emotional states and because you know there's there's a lot of physiology and a lot of physiological connections between like the chemicals and things in our body that also help drive those emotions and I think we need them and I think artifi technological artifacts are missing at least I'm not going to say if we've tackled sufficiently the higher level cognitive uh Behavior because you know there's still the work being done in cognitive architectures and cognitive modeling um although I also think that we're because we're missing half which is the emotional side of things and the biophysical drives and manipulations we're missing that entanglement so the design of our intelligence system is sort of like detached we're still in many ways in Ai and we also mention this in that paper uh you might have heard of brain inovat right which is the idea of what you can think of it intuitively it's an old cognitive it no one really ever said it it's more of like a criticism of old cognitive science which is to say that neural processing our mental representations our decisions and that we make and our plans that we make and our complex logical order processing are completely divorced of the body right it's the extreme uh it's essentially mortal Immortal computation which is kind of another fun thing we pointed out um but in the cognitive sciences and philos philosophy of Mind realm and because we've been designing things from that perspective for so long uh we're missing that entanglement and I think there's some of the roadblocks we will face in the future some of the things we can't necessarily build maybe the holy Grails that still remain like you know higher order logical reasoning and uh complex planning that you know Transformers and the big neural models can't really quite do today despite claims that are being made uh from the public relations of different companies um I think that we're missing that other piece of the equation that could have helped inform and make those processes that we design better but we're also missing that relationship so that entanglement blue is inherently not there uh which is there in for example human entities and animals and or living beings right we have that interplay and then we have the ability to decide if we want to override it but technological artifacts don't have that there's nothing override right so um at least I'm going to make that claim I'm sure that there's probably there is this world called Effective computing um but I'm not 100% clear if whether or not that has all the ingredients that I would say need to be in place to build that 50% of the entanglement of emotion to higher level cognition and reasoning and non-emotional reasoning um so and we need that so i' would love to have that and then we could then quantify that entanglement right and talk about the relationship or proportion of emotional processing or even low-level biological processing to higher level or cognitive processing and planning and decision making I don't know if blue heard that but I see her thing green so okay yeah wow I I brought up an image this is a figure 1.2 from the textbook with the high road and the low road so the low road how it's constructed and that's basian but we could consider other ways that things are actually built like JF clout you're working on the symbolic active inference so programs from the bottom up or there could be different heterogenous elements we talked about Quantum and neuromorphic so as many material substrates as there are material substrates to be inclusive of what ecosystems actually consist of and then first principles thinking first principles approaches including the free energy principle or unified through consideration with the free energy principle all of these terms that include complex systems phenomena self-organization autop is like you mentioned and how the current narrow or whatever it is computer science that we continue to ride inertia and acceleration on from the kind of Von noyman architecture um and scaling in in materials with a lot of costs like that is almost missing these two compliments one of them is the top- down organizing principle though there are organizational principles within computer science of course it's a formal field but unified principle and then almost like in a in a very interesting relation that that I hope people can explore later is this other complimentary relationship between I mean to put it coarsely like the heart and the brain and the integration with the hands and about pragmatic value and the a effective value and blue you ask like what if we're what if we're like least aware of what we offloaded it's like that's we're we're only aware of what we not offloaded so every every if we just take a a mental survey of what we know that's the remainder of what we don't know and that's a very different very integrated compressible perspective that then can unroll a lot of different ways that isn't just like we have to do what we're doing now but just more well and just a quick Point there's also this beautiful concept called and it's being embraced in cognitive science more recently because it was even the theme of cogi I believe last year cognitive diversity you know and so uh and that's the beautiful part of embodiment the embodiment thesis in cognitive science which is it can give you an explanation of all the different ways in which we might have something more offloaded than you know not uh into the different varying degrees and so even maybe the question sometimes isn't what's optimal but rather can we capture the wide array of different amounts of cognitive offloading because if you change the body you change the cognition and that's like the embodiment thesis in its natural and this paper Echoes that extreme kind of of you a bit that if you change the body you're going to change the thinking and fundamentally and you we know this even even internally within the same body if you are feeling sick if you are feeling uh hungry or you have these you're even if you you can fight these things with a top- down approach to some degree but uh it will affect for example your focus if you're sick it's harder sometimes to write a paper you have something called brain fog right and so that's where the body is so intimately involved uh in our biophysics and our physiology so intimately involved in our everyday processing that uh and different people are affected to different degrees I mean I'm sure there's someone out there who like no I'm uh maybe they had for example h a really bad cold and they're like no I was able to get the same amount of work done as always right I mean and that would also show you that it's going to be vastly different even within the same type of entity and so um that that's something cognitive diversity I think gets captured by this type of thinking and it could be really interesting you know from using the premise of a mortal computer to sort of construct systems that are like that and by the way the Mortal computer rests on that nice diagram that you have there you know with active inference and the free energy it sort of tries to hit most of those main points and sort of like agglomerate them into well we even propose a definition right right I mean is it a complete definition I'm sure there's extensions uh there's probably corollaries to add to the Mortal computation thesis um but I just wanted to throw that point in there because I think that that's where it's that that how much we offload will also change even if it's like maybe not optimal but you know that would be more dictated by an evolutionary process um but you have different entities and different organisms that offload to different degrees and depending on your body and what affordances it gives you what what abilities it offers you to interact with affordances in the environment and tools and things like that um if I had eight legs I'm going to be able to do drastically different things than you know with my bipedal body right now and morphological robotics usually explores some of that um what can different bodies beyond the humanoid style uh provideing for example quadruped robots which they take you know another thing in nature like oh let's say animals like dogs and cats but they're wonderful for like search and rescue right whereas a bipedal system might struggle to get into certain spots but if we had a qu and there we've changed the body and hence we've changed the cognition in the mental neural processing yeah a lot lot just even from the outside of robot otics I hear about cognitive robotics so the adjective is saying well we're pulling back to consider cognitive architectures and then there's another layer which is like well how does it get there what's the developmental trajectory and then what is the Ecology of similar or different minds and and bodies and then what's the evolutionary process you can keep the um like you you you again in in in um kind of Distinction describe the immortal it's designed as if Immortal but of course in reality the Linux operating system or any given language model is Mortal you just unplug it because its energy resources aren't accounted for so it's kept in this suspended bar life state where it's at the behest of something else and so then that like unsustainability propagates through a system causing externalities so ensuring that the externalities can be under understood where they are it leads so we expect to scalable interpretable systems that don't just hide the semantic ambiguity and the um material components they're so abstractly considered and it's so un integratable with emotive components that it feels like a dead endend so I hate to keep talking about Mortal computation but we're doing it well it is your it's your guys podcast I'm happy to lab about anything I just want to make sure that if you wanted to talk about those Pap by the way we did talk about those papers last time too and they're integrated right maybe we can relate some of them like I keep bringing the Cog engine paper not because it of itself is Mortal but uh I argue that it is a piece of that puzzle like if I were to go yeah that architecture there that's not a mortal computer however it is a cognitive architecture and I think it plays a role in the design of systems right for example maybe blue it helps it would help us for example to design higher level processing to counteract some of the lower level emotive uh you know decisions that an agent would want to make so I just want to make a mention I'm fine with talking about whatever I'm the one that shamelessly plugged I just actually wanted to plug it and then you know we could go from there if you but the there they're they're intertwined right it it's not like my thinking is oh when I work on Cog engine I turn off the Mortal computer it's like no they're all they're all swirling around it's all part of the same thought so if you want to keep talking about it be my guest I'm your guest so I ju I just have a question about like when we talk about scalability and interpretability um I I wonder how much interpretability is due to the fact that you know we're missing that emotive setup right like so if we have some kind of interplay between like persistence emotion thought like if there's some kind of you know struggle like who's winning the the war when we make a decision when we choose to act um are we going to lose interpretability when we start to design mortal computation like or is there a way that we can keep interpretability I mean I guess we do all the programming so you know you keep there is is it going to end up being more black box if we have like I mean a human is way like I don't know what's like I just compute you know I don't know what's going on I mean I could try to check in and like where's this coming from is this my logical brain or is this from my heart or is it just like you know a a motor like kinesthetic memory or or that's driving me to act in in a certain way like I can try to dissect it but even it's hard to know my own like computational process so when we're looking at like designing an artificial system are we going to lose that interpretability in in the design is that like built in well fascinating uh point or fascinating premise I think it depends not to bust out the famous it depends answer and any of my students listening will be like well there he goes under the shield of it depends but it really does and I think it depends on what interpretability you're looking for and I'm also going to mix and it is different to some degree explainability and I'm G to bring in that word here because there there's those that work in like interpretable AI versus explainable Ai and they can get pretty mad if you like say oh it's the same thing and it's not quite um so in designing let's say a mortal computer let's even say like a so in the paper we also uh have sort of like Beginnings uh Because by the way we are encouraging everyone to contribute we have sort of like a lowlevel or what we call a homeotic or homeostatic mortal computer and then things that have other processes are allostatic and things that are at the top level the complex computer would be autoptic and that would be like the ideal that would be like oh well there we have a human right we have an animal we have at least a sentient organoid um yeah if you're looking for Daniel it's like after it's in section five uh under the definition but if you wanted to see that little it's like it's sort of a taxonomy uh and then we use it to evaluate modern day mortal computers no scroll it's not a picture no no no it's a under the definition it's it's a bullet point scroll down you were CL it's it's weird to find it all right yeah go down that's the definition and then you scroll down right there so there yeah we you had it you had it right there uh scroll up a little more no a little more scroll a little more there homeostatic allostatic autopedic so we sort of give a little bit of a characterization of like Mortal computers of varying complexity um so I'm referring to this just in answering Blue's question if I designed the ideal MC mortal computer uh autoptic right so it has all the ingredients we want and you're saying is it interpretable do we lose some interpretting I would argue not completely you will from a so the the parts of interpretability you preserve and I think it's even better in some ways than your run-of-the-mill Transformers and large neural models that are in operation today is when for example chat GPT or GPT 5 or stable diffusion does something really interesting like oh it can do this Downstream task that I never expected to do uh like zero shot learning which you know arguably is very interesting and promising that these models can do some elements of this uh type of adaptation we can't answer why that happens the best answer we have is well it's because we keep throwing more and more parameters at these models more neurons more synapses that connect them and so if I toss more Legos at this it'll just emergent you know through emergence create complex behavior and we get these nice little properties and it's interesting because that does relate to complex system complex adaptive systems theory like John Holland's work in the 90s and the Santa Fe Institute um and other other people that have worked on dynamical systems and uh complexity Theory and how you get complex structures that emerge from these very simple structures and self-organization was actually on Daniel's uh hierarchy it was like a one piece of an organizing principle so that part is like the part where it might be hard to completely interpret uh why does this Behavior emerge because it is this complex multi-level interaction of parts and you could at least say it comes from like and we do talk about it too in the paper uh because we do talk about self organization is you can't without if you're going to talk about any living system you have to go into self-organization uh upward causation and downward causation so upward causation is like the little Parts give rise to complex emergent Parts um and then their relationships to each other and then the top down causation is you have these higher level parts that have now laws and physical relationships and implicit relationships with each other that exert like a modulation modulatory effect on the lower level parts and so that's why you have top down bottom up like caus arrows of causation and interaction and constraint so to give rise to a complex system um and so you can point to those pieces and say well that's the reason why certain behaviors probably emerged um but then you get into nonlinear systems and it's very very hard to even you know well mathematically analyze them um let alone you know come up with intuitive qualitative pictures of what's going on but the part that you also get in designing a mortal computer and like the Cog engine architecture that Daniel has here on the slide is you get interpretability in terms at least the structure and some roles especially if we're talking about like the internal States like the reason I like the common model of cognition and there's other you know theories and blueprints out there it's not to say it's the only one um but the reason I really like it is it sort of cuts up or cleaves the mind up into these G eneral Blobs of responsibilities and has some relationships it doesn't commit you to any implementation as we talked about uh at Point the podcast point. one but it sort of tells you like oh procedural memory it's going to be doing this very specific thing right it's going to learn how to memorize sequences of actions kind of like a reactive physiological physical reactive components and you know the way I interpret it was the transition Dynamics model of active inference or let me build a predictive coding little structure that tries to guess latent States but then you have like declarative memory and it stores the facts of the world things that you know I I bind the name of a person to their face and you know I'm storing these little bits of knowledge into my representations and declared in memory so you get the interpretability at least at the level of I know what these modules are doing I probably could investigate and probe in even a computational fashion the content of memory uh cognitive architectures in general and so that's the part that I like they bring at least a level of interpretability because you have this organizational principles you have responsibilities for different modules and even classical cognitive architectures have things like production systems and you can encode knowledge into them uh there's uh good work on like you know if then statements and you can kind of break up knowledge into at least bits and pieces of logic and we can very easily inspect that right uh and so the uh while that might not be computational in the most efficient way uh we could probably do mappings between the neural representation since they're essentially mimicking what like actar and sore and very classic prominent cognitive architectures are trying to do to these production systems there's been good work even from yashua's group uh he had a paper uh neural production systems which I kind of like that idea about how do we emul that piece of cogn cognitive architectures with you know just neural networks um and so we can we can take advantage of that mapping and we could probably get some decoding going on and interpret some pieces of our agent system mortal computer um and also by the way the very design of the Mortal computer you actually would have a clear picture of like well these are the essential variables or the metabolic pathways here are the homeostatic process CES these are the things I defined that Define the life of this system or otherwise it will die right and then the allostatic processes live above that and so that's what that like cool picture that I really like in the middle of the paper the biophysics shows you like the hierarchy of different types of processing that would happen from biology and then the cybernetics tells you what is it going to do from like an analysis point of view it's you know trying to uh you know find stable state it wants to be ultra stable to use ashbs and the cyberneticists old terms right and that's you know I'm able to very quickly uh satisfy my constraints so I can keep living and not you know die um and essentially preserve uh or have enough internal variety to counterbalance my external variety and that's the cybernetician uh kind of framing of what's going on in in in organizing systems and so you get that interpretability in terms of the design you know the parts the mechanisms behind it but you will lose the piece of like why did that behavior specifically come about it's going to be a nonlinear process so you will lose it and I don't think you can get all of that back here's the last point I said at the very beginning explainability now this is different than interpretability and the way I it's going to be my digested version of explainability so blue you were saying to me earlier uh I might be able to inspect the contents of my mind and come up with a reasoning for why I did something and then you mention that well it could be wrong or you know I might not completely capture it and I agree because we do this in all the fields right like especially anything about the mind I try to think about the contents of why I did something or what was going on in my brain or break down my process and then try to turn that into a Model A computational model that then explains like the actual entity and it might be wrong it might be biased however there's something cool about what you doing that that's the explainable part ybl might not know the true reason the real reason of the universe or the biological reasoning or the thermodynamic cognitive reasoning of why you did something specifically however you can provide an explanation or a rationalization of why you did it and while it might not be perfect and we shouldn't you know take the account as wholesale the exact truth um you are able to communicate the basis of your decision so you are able to use your construct your biology your neuroprocessor to formulate and then of course we also have this thing called communication you use the other parts of your body to transmit those sound waves to me and Daniel across a tool Zoom um and we hear what you're saying and you say oh I I when I wanted to solve this problem I did X Y and Z and what we would find is then if we did X Y and Z maybe that's not exactly the true explanation why you did it but I would be able to solve the problem now and we teach right we pass on this knowledge and so the explainable part might arise I think that might counterbalance the lack of interpretability so while we might not be able to say exactly 100% I still argue we have more interpretability than monolith structures like Transformers today where we just say it emerged and that's cool right I mean there is probably analysis I don't want to like completely dismiss uh Transformers there probably is interesting work on maybe identifying what parts of the network but from the design principles or the inductive bias that Evolution gave us I think a cognitive architecture gives you some interpretability in a structural way but then you're going to get a mortal computer that would probably be able to explain to you why did it do this because why the 5 cognition theory that Carl and I have doesn't it absorbs or expands for E cognitive theory which includes embedded and the embedded cognition is really important because that's part of that like other diagram I had where I had the slices of a pie of cognition in a mortal computer and among there it's saying I have to interact with other well I had other neuro robots but I'm talking to you blue and that means that I have to be able to communicate some approximation of why I did something and there is an explainable you know there's explainability and I communicate this reasoning to you you give me feedback and you know we we kind of come up with a solution to the problem or a better understanding of something and I think that's where the Mortal computer in its full Glory would give you right because it would be able to tell you why it would interact with you because it also needs to because you're part of its Niche you affect its survival so it can't sort of like uh oh okay I'm just gonna ignore you because actually it might be really important you might be important for it to achieve its goals which could be to allow it to get more power if we go back to the Primal connection there's a lot of jumping around going on here but you are an essential part we human humans all of us are an essential part of what a true mortal computer would be this is what makes it artificially sentient too right and it it has to live in its Niche and the niche you know can get very complex it's not going to be a laboratory that I put it in a little uh whitew room and you know oh okay I've emulated life no ultimately you would want this to integrate with human society and to interact with us because there's things that you get that with a group with a colle itive with social norms that you don't get living in pure isolation and so you're going to get that it's not interpretability but it's explainability and I think that that communication and that part might counterbalance the fact that we're dealing with as you rightly point out blue an extremely nonlinear complex system that it's gonna be very hard to say exactly why did it do what it did based on inspection of its contents even if we designed it so the explainable part I think will counterbalance that to some degree wow sounds like Psychotherapy Psychotherapy for the Mortal computer there you go yes we need it there's so many pieces to add in I barely know where to go yeah it's a it's a it's a lot you brought out I think the connection to complexity science is very good because that's where we can ask and have a laboratory for like well what's the account you can give of this double pendulum what's the account you can give of wolfram's rule 30 what's and and by that we can contextualize yeah how how many experiments of what type would we expect before we could understand a fruit flies decision in a tze what about a human in this or that and then this tension but fundamental so we can quickly come to adapt to it that there's things we do and don't know about it's one of the quotes beginning a chapter in the 2022 textbook I think it's like a Minsky quote we're aware of least what are brains do best and so that whole like searching under the street light with a light of attention that every agent is only engaged in as a fundamental constraint that's one constraint is the attentional informational another constraint is the material physical Niche which is always actual and that's that's um connected to the environment totally fundamentally like there can't be a discussion of what ant colony foraging strategy works best even for one field location there's going to be different ant species with different total strategies and different nestmates with sub strategies as modeled by so you've embarked on a wildly fundamental task that combines a lot of the discussions happening in active inference with the broader cognitive Sciences broader complex systems and it's definitely interesting and relevant so I really appreciate that you share it this way now happy you guys uh took to it so well and uh I certainly want that idea out there so now now that there's a what do you call it a a proper treatment an initial treatment of mortal computation please spread the word you know I want I want to hear other people come back to me like oh yeah I heard about the Mortal computer and I'd love to see you guys and everyone else try to take a whack at designing even the most PR versions of it because I think this is like I don't know if it's quite that but it almost feels like uh like a little baby step because if this paper is uh is uh intensive as it has been uh and informative and so fun working with Carl on it um it is just a step in a big direction as you just said Daniel and it's a wild wild place and it also goes at odds with a lot of like maybe this group here you know we're a lot more what do you say receptive and excited by these prospects but it does go even to challenge a lot of what we hold dear and near and dear to ourselves which is the we really do like our Immortal computers and you know there there's there's going to be tradeoffs to that and the paper does talk about that it even starts by trying to address the reader by saying the reader might ask you know themselves you know why do I really want this because it's also very brittle I'm gonna just be clear too but then again humans and animals and organisms are also brittle as well um but why do I want this right and you know and then we had we motivate this with like a three kind of stabs which is thermodynamic which is the most important and by the way the free energy principle um in physicists in the room might say well wait a minute free energy that's thermodynamic why this is not quite the same thing there's the mixture of information theory in here as well but you know the thermodynamic free energy is a really important piece to this puzzle and the the way that computers are organized is sort of what this challenge is and you know it also we have tools to attack this like neuromorphic chips wonderful wonderful platform uh for uh you know a mortal computer uh and we do talk about it in the supplement it got moved to the supplement because again I was already a little bit too long um so I talk about neuromorphic architectures and the also neuromimetic algorithms which kind of connect to the papers too like predictive coding it isn't like front and center I don't we don't try to like throw it in your face uh even though it is a a one way of thinking a a consequence of free energy minimization but um and so we talk about these things but I think it challenge we also talk it also challenges and gets us to think about existentialism uh and life and philosophy of life and death because we there was even citations to haiger uh and uh and all kind saurin and all all kinds of wonderful thinkers too that have just thought about philosophy of mind and how uh our identities and our our thought processes are just naturally influenced by the fact that we know uh that you know things are going to possibly end um and wonderful thinkers and there's also been this concept of like again this is a little hiigaran but uh you know your your being there's this famous book being in time and you think about well you know at the end of time you you have to understand when you live you're projecting your being to there and then going backwards and so there's a quote that kind of starts the paper from sarin kard about uh you know we we look at life backwards but we must live it forwards and there's that interaction with knowing that this this Rodeo is this play is not going to last forever um which is a motivator for why we do a lot of things including teaching and passing on uh to the Next Generation and the other part was again cognitive science I think cognitive science got a little bit of a spotlight uh because it needed to I think the embodiment thesis inactive cognition and then kofs and and and and his Ro and his collaborators life mind continuity thesis needed to sort of be foregrounded a little bit um because I think that's another piece of this puzzle uh and it kind of ties everything together about how to think about minds and brains but it all challenges what things we're we're very used to we're very used to when we design especially artificial intelligence okay I I trust this Hardware is good I'm going to try to build some software and I believe that I can design all my processes uh from you know from scratch without even accounting for maybe what you know Evolution might have given us uh we are seeing some of that especially basian uh framings have some of that in there right the idea of a prior uh I think is important but a lot of modern-day neural systems don't 100% I think foreground that uh and play how important these priors are to sort of like driving your behavior and so that's what's kind of be interesting is that this is truly a weird place to be and it also really says you got to have a body you got to have an environment so you're not done if you say I have this wonderful algorithm that I think emulates some piece of intelligence that's wonderful but that's not going to be the end of the story in fact you're far from the end of the story you need to be integrating that into a brittle body where that process that you've designed is also going to be shaped now by the substrate right and its interactions its thermodynamic exchange with the environment the environment itself is going to change how it works and so you sort of get this malleable flexible kind of framing of AI as well that intelligence is you just no longer can divorce it from the mechanics of interaction with interacting with the world you cannot divorce it from the thermodynamic exchange that's how we're going to get energy efficient AI I think that's like the the other main message but it's challenging right and others will say well I have Quantum Computing and it is very promising it's not any dismissal of it um I just going to do the same AI I've always done but faster and do I really need to look at you know how life emerges do I really need to look at how neurons really do things um you know it'll be interesting if nothing else there might be a little bit of a race going forward maybe it'll be the Mortal Computing still you know on its pedestal being the dominant Paradigm and Mortal Computing being rather Niche for a while I mean it's kind of same thing with the free energy principle and active inference I like to think of the Mortal computation as you know another a big expansion of free energy and active inference because you know active inference is a core lar of the free energy principle and at its mortal computer's heart is the free energy principle right it talks about the non-equilibrium steady state the Ness and that's kind of like at the core and we cast there's the other parts of the paper there's a lot of parts of the paper about uh inference learning and structure and you cannot ignore any of those pieces if you're going to build a proper and that's actually part of our definition there's an entanglement there that's a whole another conversation but um it know it's like an expansion of the free energy principle it says you know well what would where does this go next and it's really like how free energy often is used in the literature to explain other phenomenon in like for example Carl and many others try to use that to do things in neuroscience and neurophysiology and computational Psychiatry this is what would happen if you take the free energy principle and you merge it with Hardware considerations and morphology and place it in the world of AI and you know say what if our goal is for in silico artificial sentience not sentients artificial sentience and our artifacts well this is where it's like natural consequence so i' like to think of as like an extension and like placing a pathway if you come from that line of thinking so all of you guys the active inference institutes like perfect candidates right because you're you're studying deeply the free energy principle um sting mortal computation is just like the next step right it's like okay well that's another piece to this puzzle it's where you go if you want to build technological artifacts with what we would consider sentients if that makes sense blue want to add anything sure um I mean I I I have millions of questions but um nothing pressing but this one I think maybe goes back to um you talking about cognitive diversity and then Daniel mentioning like shining the light of attention um and just as we're as we're thinking about um like attention as as maybe like the foundation for cognitive diversity because like while we are all fundamentally have the same programming the same like voluntary and involuntary Consciousness right I guess we'll say it like that like my heartbeat and kind of the my self sustaining system um we can kind of make that conscious like I've mentioned the breathing but also like just through like motor control like you can activate motor circuits like we all have different different like some people can spread their toes out and some people cannot like if you've never tried to do that like it's hard and you have to like practice practice practice but then like through constantly paying attention to those like neural connections neuromuscular connections you you gain like a different perspective um than others and so just um in terms of cognitive diversity for humans it is going to look really different like within like in species and inter species diversity um is going to be crazy right like you know a tardigrade doesn't even have a toe to spread maybe they do I don't know um I don't think they have toes but but um just across the different species maybe we this is the time to kind of look a little closer at like procedural memory long-term memory like at what like what is long-term memory right like I if um you know when you're looking at something like an insect that doesn't really have a brain definitely doesn't have like a hippocampus to store the long-term memory do you get um long-term memory does it go into the generative model like or where does it go like I mean you think about they just have like the working buffer memory or if you were to try to design one of these cognitive kernels for a non-human um like maybe you don't have to go to a plant but like where would you start to kind of add or subtract things like long-term memory because we know that that's really different just even in the animal kingdom well I first of all I agreed with most of what you were saying at the beginning and that that just resonated with cognitive diversity um if uh talking about like how would I design like or begin to think about something like a fruit fly as opposed to you know a human again the moral computation definition and like the general Framing and let's just again for the audience members that might join in and say wait Wen what are they talking about that's not in any of the four papers we mentioning let's just think of the Mortal computation thesis as subsuming all of these because I think of all those just as a quick point to all of that work I think is in service of this uh even though this was written far more recently and I know blue you were going to ask at one time what was the history of the ordering of these papers but um obviously they're not in a a strict sequence um so it's like moral computation is like one way to do a synthesis of all these ideas um now to build like something like a fruit fly mortal computation just says you need at least at its heart a generative model right everything's a generative model but the form of that generative model is not con you know it's not specified um because there's the the principles like for example in that paper brings up the cybernetic ideas of like the good regulator theorem I'm sure you guys have encountered this too because you kind of ARL especially in any discussion with those with free energy they always borrow from cybernetics it's impossible so law of requisite variety and the good regulator theem are like kind of like the most wellknown that paper talks about a lot of other ones that I don't think get enough attention so all the axioms of cybernetics are kind of in that paper but uh the good regulator theorem and the principle of model internal control which is not as popular as good regulator but you sort of need those at the formation of any of these entities and so as long as you're able to design the body of that fly and you are I'm assuming you're going to study the object in reality right so you're going to study the actual fruit fly and hopefully extract principles because again this is biomimetic so the title of the paper says we are mimicking or performing mimicry of biology or the things that we perceive in our real world the physiological organisms and so if you're able to study the fruit fly I would imagine you're constructing a body that's very similar to it tries to adhere to as many of its physics and physical principles that govern how it moves and interacts and its exchange with materials you have all that part I think you're almost there believe it or not that's the kind of the fun part of the mortal computer is designing that Markov blanket implicitly explicitly however you want to go about it and placing in a niche gets you really close because again embodiment offloads a lot of that cognition because that fruit fly does a lot of what it does based on reactions and uh its U interactions with its Niche and that is where in like the 5e cognitive theory of the paper uh the bottom the most let's say you need this because you it influences everything else is called well Carl and I did introduces the it's a rewrapping of Basil cognition you need Elementary cognition which you could just if you want to call it basil cognition that's also fine we cite the heck out of that uh in Michael Levan's group and many other biologists so you would be implementing that level so you'd say if I'm going to build the fruit fly I'm not going to be building you know uh you know embod well you're going to get embodied cognition from that but you're not going to be building these complex processes you're going to focus on that slice that's what's kind of nice about 5 the is you can slice it up and say I'm going to design at this level um obviously it the bottom level affects the upper level so you sort of do have to account for that and so you would be saying well what are the basil cognitive functions that Define something like a fruit fly what does it do what would evolution of given it because if you're not going to simulate Evolution which would give you those things if you know properly done and with enough compute uh you're going to design those inductive biases you're going to hopefully study the fruit fly and then its internal cognitive model will not be the common model of cognition because the common model of cognition is sort of like okay that was the product of the human evolutionary track right and that's what evolution gave us is like our organizing principle of the brain but other animals don't necessarily have that to the same degree and creatures as you get smaller and smaller and simp let's say different on the Spectrum especially as you move towards things that are a little bit simpler like single cell organisms they're going to have a lot less of that functionality but still under the hood is that generative model it just might not be a generative model as in like oh I have a neural circuit that's trying to predict the next uh state of the environment like a fantasy or a dream sequence that I unroll out like we humans can sort of like oh let me think about what's going to happen if I close my eyes and I knock over the computer we can use our internal physics simulation to figure out what it's going to do and say nah I'm not gonna do that whereas a flute fly might have some sense of physics but it might not be like Oh I'm rolling out over long-term trajectory so I'm not going to be building for example um a procedural memory or an episodic memory quite like what I do in the common model of cognition and I might only need very simple little neural circuits because again the number of neurons and for example like insects is really really really small and that's why we can study them better too that's also why people study that or even like it's not necessarily the same as a fruit flights it's a lot simpler but still fascinating is C Elegance right has been studied a lot because we can map out every single bit of its neural circuits and that and of itself is rather complex so I would argue that the fruit fly cognitive model will be simpler will and it will be dictated by what we decide are the elementary cognitive functions uh that make its mortal computer it a mortal computer and we won't need you know these complex moduls uh interacting in the way we do uh in for example you know a human model or let's say an animal model um I think the that's but again that's grounded in something like you understand you're mimicking so if you go with the route of biomimicry you should probably be studying the fruit fly or at least understand what we understand about it and dissect that and bring back what are its base functions and then how am I emulating that and then you know you build your little cognitive internal States right inside the Marco blanket that maintain for example what are the V essential variables that the fruit fly needs to maintain it's not going to be the same biochemical processes that dictate a human right like for example when we have blood we're looking at like pH level and temperature the fruit fly might be looking at a little bit different essential variables right certain con chemical concentrations matter to it more um you'd want to model that and I think that that by the way when you talk about the basil cognition in designing it my my thought on this is that you are approaching it from what are those life sustaining variables that characterize that start from there and then you say okay well does explain some of the things that I observe you know let's say again we're modeling at this point but you know what the fruit fly does like for example flying around why does it fly around well maybe it's because it needs to you know reach this particular nutrient and so it knows if I go to this region I am more likely to achieve it that might be an allostatic process right and You' say okay there's something that I need uh and this could also be like a bottomup design right if you don't think that you need like the inductive bias that's provided by the common model you sort of build your little functions as needed and now you build your little internal generative model your good regulator right into the fruit fly based on the key functions it needs to satisfy so that it does not die right um and ultimately the best way to probably do this is then you simulate Evolution right and maybe you let some natural selection happen because if you don't want to design those processes then you'd want to simulate you know the origins of it and by the way mortal computation doesn't ignore Evolution here it doesn't talk about designing it because you know that's a whole realm in of itself but even the life mind continuity thesis from kof's group uh they talk about you need a selection history and I think the only way to get around the selection history is and you say well okay if I'm not going to simulate the selection history and let you know these Primitives emerge into the structures that make for example fruit fly work you need to figure out well what was those what was the product of our current n selection history right what did Evolution do to give the fruit fly as is so it's you got like two choices study the real thing and try to emulate some of those very basic principles like identifying its essential variables identifying allostatic processes that might service those essential variables in the homostasis of them or the hormesis of them um or talk about some very basic Primitives and then say I'm going to simulate a population of these and that might be more difficult because if you're dealing with the actual like let's say you have a little fruit fly robot since we're talking about substrates that might be not very cheap to do where it might be easier to do it in simulation and doing it with a digital morphology and that's another can of warms so I don't know if that kind of gives you something blue no it definitely does um and like yeah so sorry my my brain works faster than my tongue sometimes insects definitely have brains just nothing like our brains they just definitely don't have brains like ours right like so nothing that we can map analogously over um although some of the neurotransmitters and things still work but just in a different functional way to my to my knowledge um also Andrew Baron is building like a tremendous model of the honeybee brain that is just so super cool I think if you don't know his work it's really really NE send me a link to that I'd love to see that that sounds awesome yeah it's way cool um has them running around in mazes and doing all kinds of learning like how to tell a van go apart from a Monae I mean they're they're really doing some pretty pretty complex uh stuff and and and that's why like it's um you know always makes me wonder like where does this stuff go like like where does where is the memory there um and and it's just it's such a fascinating process to me um how memories are created and stored and like how they map into the brain and like sometimes I can pull something up right away and like sometimes it'll take me four days to remember someone's name like what was the name of and like I'll remember it I'll be just driving down the road it was whatever and like it's just like how many layers of circuitry did I have to like transgress to get from A to B you know um and like yeah how how do different kinds of animals do that is always really fascinating to me I think a piece of that too is evolution also has a memory right right and I think that selection history is what goes into things like for example the fruit fly right so there's its predecessors you know you know maybe they did certain other behaviors that were not in conducive to their survival I think there's that too that implicit kind of memory and then that gets encoded uh in the morphology right and this is where it goes back to where I just said if you want it or like your your collaborator your friend that you mentioned about designing like the honeybees uh it's kind of the same principles you say well okay what did Evolution give it let me design that you're just skipping the evolutionary phase and I think there's some memory in the structure too so this is where the body now of course your example about you retrieving it there's layers of intricacy there like I'm not cleaning about that but even like the fruit fly why does it remember to do certain things or why does it seem to have certain patterns and that's also what the moral computation thesis does in account for or at least tries to by saying that it is because that body changes and it's you know subject to a selection history because it's constantly in this eternal change of repair and maintenance in the face of disintegration because it's always the threat of disintegration uh your your your identity will cease when you die um and so because of that things get encoded in that memory and that's also this beautiful piece of like the interplay of physics and cybernetics um this is without ever getting into the probably wonderful Quantum interpretations I'm sure Chris Fields could Enlighten us all about um but you know the idea that information or variety gets encoded into these intera through its interactions gets encoded into the morphology the very organization and structural manifestation of that organization because organization is not structure it is the relationships of the parts and it can exist independent of the manifestation and the manif station is like oh okay here's the body that embodies those principles that also encodes that is a memory because for example uh an organism that understands a particular chemical interaction might say well look I need to filter out this toxin or I'm gonna die and I need pump in these nutrients that's a memory it's just not a retrievable memory it's just like an implicit memory um but that's why for example it's able to conduct the actions that it does and this is why mortal computation really tries to and this is where I think it's very forward thinking or very far ahead of what we can probably even do easily which is it really says you do need to understand the body the substrate is so important and understanding how that will then affect the internal States and how you do this processing that has to be at the front and center of your story of whatever you build um and then the niche you can't escape the niche you're you're kind of by having a body you're like well okay but the body only existed because it was in response to the environment and it was you know it has evolved or it has adapted because of the pertubations the environment has subjected it to um and so I think that that's what that's why I like the thesis so much is it's kind of say we need to flip our thinking a bit not okay we're going to design the brain and someday in the future we'll have good bodies for it I think that that was valuable and it has produced some interesting things but it can only get you so far and then you miss at least 50% of the puzzle that could also inform that design where we talked earlier about like emotions and you know I don't I wouldn't argue that the systems that we have today despite the media claims and you know there's the stuff with open Ai and I saw some comments about oh well you know Alton and others they they have some secret AGI program but I've heard conspiracies about that stuff all the time so I I don't I put too much Credence to it um I don't think that they've cracked the the emotional nut the biophysical nut I think it's more like a we've had lots of people either argue study very specific slices of it um but those voices need to be echoed right and so that's what I think the moral computation is an echo as well of at least like a century of thought uh and it's saying this is how we can approach artificial general intelligence and then it can account for things like the fruit fly actually your uh the the you said Andrew was his name on the work on like Honeys that to me is an example of if you know he's got a learning component and an influential component and there is some organiz he has a body he has a niche you know that that's very close to an in silico version of a mortal computer right I you know the only other components that it might be more like an allostatic MC so and again in the paper we have a table uh and Carl did want that to stay I was going to move it to the appendix again length um so we made a compressed table of different types of uh moral computers and we kind of characterize them there's a few that are autopedic we actually do have very like uh organoids really really close to what you would want right but they're all biophysical so there's not like a oh I designed something on a neuromorphic chip with predictive coding like what I would do um this is you know oh we're using stem cells to construct this microphysiological architectures I do think that has a placed a super important role going forward and I would only hope that there's some democratization of an exchange of ideas between this wonderful really new world in machine intelligence um to learn and study organoids uh but also fungal and mold-based Computing really interesting place to be as well um and to think about how does that biophysical organization give rise to commun and those are examples of mortal computers um uh ashp's homeostat deserves a lot of love and attention because it's the oldest and really the most prominent example of what I would argu is a true in silico uh mortal computer but it's homeostatic little bit alost static depending on what you've done there's variations to it um but like the xenobots really interesting uh I think the xenobots are an example of something that they use frog cells leg cells and pieces of frogs to actually instantiate these little tiny robots that can self-heal and repair and I think that's going to be the part where we have autopedic computers already in front of us like organoids and xenobots are some of the most interesting I think profound examples of how you get this computer and then for example Andrew's work would have you know maybe the missing component so his would be more allostatic so mid-level kind of mortal computers and I'd have to read more about them but just from your exp explanation um but the structural selection the evolution of the morphology the self-replication part of the story which we also talk about as well um is more in like the xenobots and so I think it's interesting how do those two worlds interact and how do you get those properties of self-repair self uh replication which by the way if you add a mutation to self-replication you get reproduction because now that creates a new system that's now subject to Natural Selection and now you've you know essentially done reproduction and now we have an account you your your your computer has all the pieces that you know complex organisms do to also ensure their persistence which is we have Offspring right you know that's another way we project ourselves into the future uh in an indirect way so it'd be kind of cool to take like the honeybee model and think about what are the ways in which we can have its morphology be damaged and conduct self-repair and that gets into the real nitty-gritty and even it might be difficult to do right and that's where I think the this is where the Grand Challenge right it's got an open an open pathway that I don't think like any one of us has an exact candidate you know for okay there's it already exists because there'd be really no point in writing the paper um I do think the xenobots and organoids can teach us a tremendous amount about structural selection Mor morphogenesis uh and self-repair and then maybe May build like a you know a a synthetic uh you know honeybee mortal computer that also is autoptic right it's able to constantly uh repair itself to some degree I mean that that would be very interesting so the fact that you brought that up was kind of like oh that's that's probably another example of a in silico Mortal computer versus a biophysical we have we have some good examples of biophysical not as many in silico to my knowledge even like robots today they're not mortal right they there might be some interesting things I'm not aware of but uh largely they're like they have all the part s they have the ingredients I think for uh mortal computers but they're not they're not completely there yet and so I think that making a robot inherently whatever the robot system it could be the honeybee it could be an a creature that we come up with it could be humanoid um making it inherently driven by just this fundamental process of persistence is the starting point and then thinking about what are those essential variables and like we talked about the fruit fly designing all of those principles from the ground up and then at one point you got to say is this supposed to be human likee uh am i g to be able to evolve you know a population of these or am I going to need to employ uh inductive biases like a common model of cognition and I like to think of Co cognitive architectures as a possible bias and say well okay I'm going to design a brain based on these principles it could be the wrong bias but you know what we it's probably capturing a lot in you know cognitive architectures are fit to a lot of human data so they do explain a lot of different effects so I I would say it's a pretty good bet um and you bring in those biases and now you design the internal States and now you have a a very complicated mortal computer but you know the future will be a very interesting place and hopefully uh more interesting mortal computers will emerge in the future thank you Alex these are really great points in closing blue first as as much as you'd like to add and then Alex any closing thoughts that you want to kind of leave it with um just I don't know that Andrew Baron is building a robot B that would be super cool um he's just modeling the real actual biological honey be brain which does some level of mortal Computing I guess it is a mortal computer right like the the but it's not it's in Vivo not in solico um but Alex thank you so much for um entertaining all of my fun questions and for you know transing us down this like super fun path toward mortal Computing I'm super excited to read your new paper um and appreciate your time on the stream yeah thank you uh thank you blue and thank you Daniel for inviting me this was a really thrilling discussion I really like your your guys podcast series and uh and I think it's it's great that you guys are pushing for The Narrative of free energy and active inference and trying to educate the the greater public on it so my students as I already told you are fans of your channel so it was H it was my pleasure to be on here um I hope you guys enjoy the paper um and I guess as a one final comment I guess it's now sort of Our Own Private running joke uh again for those that tuned in hoping to like have a deep time into I think you guys did a good job on point zero going through all four of those papers to be fair I think that captured their Essence and then last time at the end of 0.1 I gave like a crash course on the NGC predictive coding um so just to make a final comment to sort of like tie everything together to today's I didn't actually expect I it's my fault for introducing the paper but it may it was a welcome uh derailment uh going down mortal computer but I think those four papers um you could argue are like building blocks as well there are other pieces to the puzzle of mortal computation for example my my preference or my thoughts are predictive coding which is a manifestation of free energy or variational free energy minimization that's going to be an important important piece your neural circuitry should probably adhere to that because I think it's very friendly to a lot of Hardware like neuromorphic chips so that's kind of like where all the predictive coding stuff just to think about my papers there you're like oh okay that's how that relates it's probably going to be the allostatic processes if I were to guess uh and building circuits there and building little modules like we do in COG engine uh the Cog engine paper is we have talked about it even if it's not about it specifically the common model of cognition is a wonderful bias if you want to try to skip ahead rather than evolve from the ground up to human cognition um and if we want to build a mortal computer that has aspects of human behavior we should maybe appeal to that type of bias um there's a lot more in the world and I encourage you know viewers to go into the world of cognitive science and computational Neuroscience and dig into the Eternal well that is of the knowledge there um so I recommend that and that's how that paper relates the spiking predictive coding and the convolutional which we didn't we only like sort of like touched on them briefly I'll just comment that the convolutional predictive coding paper which was like the second one that you guys talked about is like an extension of the nature paper NGC and it just says how do we do Vision processing I consider that as another version of the same building block that would go into a mortal computer and the spiking predictive coding I think is really interesting it says well if I'm going to try to get as close as I can to biophysical right and get as close as I can to neuromorphics we should be able to think about what do real neurons do so it's kind of like we're building the neuron as a little biome uh little mortal computer and of itself and we know that they communicate with spikes um and so the spiking predictive coding is like uh one way there's other ways uh to emulate predictive coding at a very fine course fine grained Dynamics level and I would imagine that that would probably be a great way to build a neuromorphic chip based mortal computer so the idea is if you get into neuromorphics and the Mortal Computing paper does talk talk about it not in great detail um it talks about even my other work uh that's beyond predictive coding like Ford forward predictive Ford forward only learning and other variants um and also Spike timing dependent plasticity and how did all those relate to the Mortal computer and I that's in a supplement so if you're like really a glutton for punishment and you can't get enough there's you know an appendix of a couple sections um and it's talked about there and so I think that you can just for the viewers of this podcast this closing podcast it could be like well that's how it all relates really it was all parts of a mortal computer and we can all pretend that from the beginning I had envisioned a mortal computer even though that only came out uh the framework in the last months I see all those parts as giving rise to that and there are tools that you can use just like Daniel brought up the whole like framework of active inference and the free energy principle and B asianism uh they're all tools that might help you build you know very powerful and interesting mortal computers whether they are simulated or whether they're real world um and then as we brought up in this one you guys have and I think it's a compliment to like some of Chris Field's teachings and some of his work there's the also the whole Quantum interpretation not Quantum Computing as a solution but rather oh mortal computer and a neuromorphic system which That's What You Know Carl and Chris did and Carl and I did in Mortal computation the interpretation from the quantum information theoretic could be a very promising uh way of formulating it and right and that might open up the doors to an extremely powerful form like in Quantum Computing so I think there's a lot of wonderful wild out there places to go but they're not too out there that's my last point that I want to make they're they're out there they go against a lot of our like I said earlier held beliefs especially those tied to Immortal computation but I also think that there's they kind of build on intuitions and ideas that have existed in other places like if we take biology and biochemistry and biophysics seriously um and we know that these things work so it's not like oh I'm going to uh do something drastically strange and controversial it's just saying let's take a little bit deeper inspiration from the world around us and living entities to build what could arguably be one way to do artificial general intelligence and ultimately artificial sentience which I think is kind of like the the final end goal right and then yeah and we end up there so thank you guys again it was so much fun talking letting thank you for letting me at some points ramble I hope my rambling was useful but you know thank you I'll give a short closing remark so first thank you blue for working on the dot zero diligently and thank you Alex for like suggesting to take on this Challenge and reading between and among the citations is like always what it's about and the engagement and the developments in the real world so it's it's just epic it's fun and it's live the research program is lived forward but experienced backwards or however it was um definitely very excited for everything you've described and on on all these topics I I hope we can continue to discuss and that people will be excited to step up and do like a 56.3 um and we can just like continue working together and I'll close actually just by reading a short selection from an abstract because I think it really contextualizes a a big um element of basian mechanics so this is the paper is there a Newton of the blade of grass by Peter Schuster 2011 so just the first sentences in 1790 Emanuel Kant makes the famous statement in his critique of judgment there will never be a Newton of the blade of grass because human science will never be able to explain how a living being can originate from inanimate matter the German naturalist Ernst heel about 70 years later celebrates Charles Darwin to be such a Newton of the grass blate hegel's enthusiasm about Darwin was not shared among his contemporaries and is not too widespread today although the pathbreaking role of Darwin's scholarly work is not the least doubted or questioned the American philosopher physicist and molecular biologist Evelyn Fox Keller says that considering Darwin as the Newton of biology is simply wrong Darwin himself has systematically avoided dwelling upon the question of how life has originated from inanimate materials natural selection begins with a living cell and I think it's actually this Nexus that you're addressing with the 1900s and early 2000s in mind that is a big one so thank you again for for undertaking the project and for joining the streams and talk to you next time yeah thank you for having me again looking forward to the next time bye byeone I
