# IDEAS

- The Active Inference Lab focuses on online communication, learning, and practice related to active inference.
- All backgrounds and perspectives are encouraged to participate in the active inference discussions.
- Regular group discussions in 2021 are scheduled for Tuesdays from 7 to 9 a.m. Pacific time.
- Feedback is requested to improve the quality of the active inference work and discussions.
- The paper "The Math is Not the Territory" by Mel Andrews is central to streams 14.1 and 14.2.
- The free energy principle (FEP) is posited as belonging to the domain of science.
- The FEP is not categorized as a theory, law, hypothesis, or research program in classical terms.
- Historical context is necessary to understand the FEP and its implications in scientific literature.
- The FEP requires dispelling several false assumptions about its framework and applications.
- A key quote from the paper is "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
- The paper aims to clarify what the FEP is and what it is not.
- Keywords associated with the paper include free energy principle, Bayesian brain, life, mind continuity, and epistemic virtues.
- The FEP utilizes a multi-scale perspective focusing on ensembles rather than reductionism or essentialism.
- The relationship between information theory and thermodynamics is explored in the context of the FEP.
- Action policy selection is framed within a cybernetic control theory approach using variational Bayesian inference.
- The Bayesian brain hypothesis suggests the brain performs inference according to Bayes' theorem.
- The relationship between the FEP and predictive coding is examined, highlighting their distinctions.
- The inactive life-mind continuity thesis posits that living systems are inherently cognitive.
- Understanding cognition requires exploring principles of biological autonomy.
- Scientific models serve as simplified representations of complex realities, facilitating explanation and prediction.
- The demarcation problem concerns distinguishing between science and non-science.
- Falsifiability is a cornerstone of scientific theory, as proposed by philosopher Karl Popper.
- The FEP does not cut at the joints of nature and does not illuminate the boundaries of natural kinds.
- The paper discusses the importance of epistemic virtues in scientific inquiry and understanding.
- Models in science can be target-directed or non-target-directed, influencing their utility and application.
- The FEP provides a normative framework but does not directly generate testable predictions or hypotheses.
- Models may reflect both structure and noise, impacting their effectiveness in scientific research.
- The relationship between scientific modeling and philosophical inquiry is emphasized throughout the discussions.
- The paper encourages open dialogue about the implications of the FEP for various fields, including cognitive science and philosophy.
- The FEP is framed as an umbrella model from which various process theories can be developed.
- Understanding the FEP could lead to advancements in active inference research and related disciplines.
