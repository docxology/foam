# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The Active Inference live stream discusses the interplay between generative models and recognition densities in the context of active inference.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference stream 6.1 focuses on team communication and learning about active inference concepts.
2. Participants introduce themselves, sharing their backgrounds and motivations for joining the discussion.
3. The paper discusses generative models and recognition densities within the free energy principle framework.
4. A key aim is to clarify interpretations of constructs related to active inference and theoretical neuroscience.
5. The authors propose an inactive interpretation of active inference, emphasizing action-oriented perspectives.
6. The distinction between generative and recognition models is highlighted, with a focus on their roles.
7. The discussion emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in cognitive science research.
8. Figures illustrate concepts like the Marov blanket and the relationship between generative and recognition models.
9. The paper critiques structural representationalist interpretations in favor of recognizing the role of action.
10. Future discussions will delve deeper into the technical details and implications of the concepts presented.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the integration of generative models and recognition densities is crucial for active inference.
2. Emphasizing action orientation can reshape interpretations of cognitive processes in neuroscience.
3. Interdisciplinary perspectives enhance the richness of discussions in cognitive science.
