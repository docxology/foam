# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter 2 discusses active inference theory, focusing on perception, action, variational free energy, Bayesian inference, and preference variables.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference theory formulates action and perception through variational approaches.
2. Variational free energy and expected free energy are key optimization parameters.
3. Perception is treated as inference rather than simple information processing.
4. Bayesian theory is fundamental to understanding priors, beliefs, and posteriors.
5. Surprise in active inference differs from psychological surprise; it's a formal statistical concept.
6. Kullback-Leibler divergence compares predictions with observed data, optimizing model accuracy.
7. Active inference defines two optimality concepts: Bayesian and Jaynes optimality.
8. The generative model interacts with the environment through a Markov blanket.
9. Preference variables influence expected free energy, differentiating it from variational free energy.
10. The chapter introduces the importance of planning as inference, distinct from perception and action.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference treats perception and action as processes of inference.
2. Bayesian principles are crucial for formulating beliefs and decision-making processes.
3. Understanding the distinction between types of surprise can enhance modeling approaches.
4. Preference variables are essential for navigating ambiguous states in decision-making.
5. The interplay of generative models and Markov blankets is key to understanding active inference dynamics.
