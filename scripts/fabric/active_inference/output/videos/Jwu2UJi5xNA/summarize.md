# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The meeting discussed modeling interactions between active and sensory states, exploring implications for behavior, explainability, and translation processes.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Chapter six focuses on modeling interactions between active states and sensory states.
2. Questions arose about the significance of vertical connections in the model.
3. Reflex arcs illustrate direct manipulation between active and sensory states.
4. Internal and external states are context-dependent and can be arbitrarily defined.
5. Modeling behavior involves understanding how states can influence each other.
6. Translation processes mix automated routines with reflective thought processes.
7. Generative models depend on defining variables and their relationships.
8. Discrete state space models explicitly evaluate sequences of actions.
9. Continuous state space models allow for approximations of behavior over time.
10. The iterative modeling process involves exploring multiple model designs and parameters.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the context is crucial for defining internal and external states in modeling.
2. Reflex arcs can be essential for explaining direct interactions in cognitive models.
3. Translation involves both automated and cognitive processes that can be modeled differently.
4. The choice between discrete and continuous models affects complexity and interpretability.
5. Iterative modeling is necessary for capturing the richness of cognitive behaviors.
