# SUMMARY
Daniel and Blue discuss the paper "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology," exploring active inference, ergodicity, and biological modeling challenges.

# IDEAS:
- Active inference is a participatory online lab focusing on applied active inference principles.
- The free energy principle (FEP) connects concepts from physics to biological systems' dynamics.
- Ergodicity ensures invariant characteristics of organisms over time in the context of FEP.
- Generalization in models may lead to loss of specificity in biological explanations.
- Dynamic equilibrium in biology refers to systems maintaining stability while exchanging energy with their environment.
- Homeostasis is a biological system's ability to maintain internal stability amidst external changes.
- Phase space represents all possible states of a biological system at any given time.
- Attractors in dynamical systems guide biological entities towards stable states over time.
- Ergodicity requires that biological systems revisit every state in their phase space, which is debated.
- Biological systems often exhibit complex, unpredictable behaviors due to evolutionary processes and environmental interactions.
- The FEP has been criticized for sacrificing biological realism for maximal generality in modeling.
- Models based on FEP may struggle to accurately reflect the dynamic nature of living systems.
- The assumptions of ergodicity and attractors present challenges in applying the FEP to real biological systems.
- Active inference's practical applications in biology require careful consideration of its foundational assumptions.
- The integration of physics into biology necessitates a nuanced understanding of each discipline's principles.
- The FEP can be viewed as a broad definition of persistence, lacking specific insights into biological mechanisms.
- The relationship between entropy and surprise is vital for understanding biological dynamics.
- Understanding homeostasis is crucial for interpreting biological systems' responses to external stimuli.
- Continuous improvement of models is essential for advancing the understanding of complex biological phenomena.
- Effective communication and collaboration in research can lead to better modeling and understanding of biological systems.
