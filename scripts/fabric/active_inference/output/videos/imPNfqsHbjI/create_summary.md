# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The active inference lab discusses the interplay between non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the free energy principle, and biological systems in live stream 31.0.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference lab aims to explore applied active inference through participatory online discussions.
2. The focus of stream 31.0 is a paper on thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology.
3. Participants introduced themselves and shared excitement about the intersection of chemistry, physics, and biology.
4. The paper critiques the foundational assumptions of the free energy principle in biological modeling.
5. The authors argue that generalizability in modeling may sacrifice biological realism and predictive power.
6. Key concepts discussed include dynamic equilibrium, ergodicity, and random dynamical attractors in biological systems.
7. The lack of attention to physics foundations in the free energy principle is identified as a significant gap.
8. The paper outlines challenges in modeling biological systems with physics concepts, emphasizing variability and complexity.
9. The authors conclude that the free energy principle may not provide new insights into biological systems.
10. Future discussions will explore the implications of these findings for active inference and biological modeling.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. The intersection of physics and biology presents unique challenges for modeling biological systems.
2. Active inference models may trade off realism for generality, affecting their practical applications.
3. Understanding dynamic equilibrium and ergodicity is crucial for applying the free energy principle to biology.
4. Ongoing dialogue in the active inference lab is vital for refining these complex theories.
5. The need for clarity in definitions and assumptions is essential for advancing research in this field.
