# IDEAS

- Active Inference Lab hosts participatory online discussions about applied active inference and related topics.
- The current live stream focuses on a paper about non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology.
- The session aims to contextualize key ideas and claims from the paper for better understanding.
- Participants are encouraged to share thoughts on the paper and its implications for active inference.
- The free energy principle (FEP) relates life to random dynamical systems at non-equilibrium steady states.
- Understanding the foundations of FEP in physics is crucial for its theoretical adequacy and practical utility.
- The balance between generality and specificity in modeling biological systems is a key concern in the FEP.
- Dynamic equilibrium in living systems involves maintaining stability while undergoing various reversible and irreversible reactions.
- Homeostasis is a key concept in biology, involving the maintenance of stable internal conditions despite external changes.
- Phase spaces represent all possible states of a system, complicating modeling due to the high dimensionality of biological systems.
- Ergodicity is an important assumption for the FEP, implying that biological systems can exhibit invariant characteristics over time.
- The existence of attractors in phase space is critical for understanding homeostatic states in biological systems.
- There are challenges in applying physics concepts, such as ergodicity and phase spaces, to biological systems due to their complexity.
- The FEP's reliance on physics may lead to a trade-off between generality and biological realism in its applications.
- The paper critiques the application of FEP to biological systems, suggesting that idealizations may limit explanatory power.
- Future discussions will explore the implications of the FEP and active inference for modeling biological systems and their dynamics.
- Clarifying definitions and assumptions in the context of FEP and active inference is essential for advancing research in these fields.
