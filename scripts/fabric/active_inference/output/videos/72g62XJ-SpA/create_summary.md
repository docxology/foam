# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Active inference live stream 7.1 discussed variational ecology and its implications for modeling complex adaptive systems and ecosystems.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active inference live stream 7.1 took place on October 27, 2020.
2. The paper discussed is "Variational Ecology and the Physics of Sentient Systems."
3. The session aimed to introduce and check in with participants.
4. Participants shared their interests in various ecosystems and their research backgrounds.
5. The discussion emphasized multi-scale ecological frameworks and niche construction.
6. Ergodicity was explored in relation to biological systems and their dynamics.
7. The paper integrates variational neuroethology with ecological perspectives on organisms.
8. The session included a roadmap for discussing the paper's main ideas and figures.
9. Participants engaged in dialogues about active inference and collective behavior.
10. The session concluded with reflections on understanding complex systems and ecosystems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference offers a framework for understanding complex adaptive systems.
2. Ergodicity varies across spatial and temporal scales in biological contexts.
3. Niche construction is crucial for modeling interactions between organisms and environments.
4. Multi-scale frameworks can integrate various biological and ecological perspectives.
5. Collaborative discussions enhance comprehension of complex ecological dynamics.
