- Understanding semantics requires precision in language and its relationship to meaning and representation.  
- The concept of representation in neuroscience raises questions about neural states and their meanings.  
- Intentionality relates to the purpose behind actions, complicating the interpretation of both human and non-human entities.  
- Narratives can be real in interpretation, yet subjective, complicating the nature of reality and truth.  
- The free energy principle serves as a foundational paradigm for understanding neural representations and cognition.  
- Combining deflationary and fictionalist accounts can yield a more comprehensive understanding of neural representation.  
- A model of adaptive phenotypes can provide a formal semantics for linking meaning to neural states.  
- The relationship between the internal and external states is crucial for understanding the dynamics of living systems.  
- Ecological context enhances our understanding of cognitive processes, integrating both biological and environmental factors.  
- Representational theories must account for misrepresentation to be truly useful and applicable in cognitive science.  
- Free energy principle highlights the importance of understanding organisms as active agents navigating their environments.  
- Bridging the gap between realism and anti-realism can lead to richer interpretations of cognitive phenomena.  
- The distinction between cognitive and computational components allows for a clearer understanding of mental processes.  
- By framing cognition within ecological parameters, we can achieve a more holistic understanding of behavior.  
- Deflationary realism emphasizes that while neural states are complex, they fundamentally represent interactions with the environment.
