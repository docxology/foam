# SUMMARY
Team Com podcast discusses Ramstead et al. (2020) paper on free energy principle and semantics.

# IDEAS:
- The paper examines the relationship between neural representations and the free energy principle.
- Semantics refers to how words convey meaning and their interrelationships.
- Active inference is a process theory describing how organisms adapt to their environment.
- The authors propose a modified fictionalist account of representations grounded in phenotypic states.
- A Markov blanket delineates internal and external states affecting an organism's actions and perceptions.
- Neural representations are often confused with cognitive meanings, complicating discussions of intentionality.
- Intentionality might extend to non-living entities, challenging traditional definitions.
- The study emphasizes the importance of ecological context in understanding cognitive processes.
- Misrepresentation in cognitive theories can lead to inaccurate conclusions about mental states.
- The authors explore whether neural representations can play an explanatory role in cognition.
- A deflationary account reduces neural meanings to their mathematical content, devoid of extra assumptions.
- Philosophical perspectives on realism and anti-realism inform the understanding of representations.
- The paper critiques the lack of ecological components in mainstream representational theories.
- Free energy principle provides a foundational framework for linking neural and semantic processes.
- The authors argue for a formal semantics arising from the dynamics of phenotypic representations.
- Cognitive science often overlooks the ecological context that shapes behavior and representation.
- Representations must allow for misrepresentation to be practically useful.
- The integration of neural states and ecological contexts enhances understanding of intentionality.
- The authors advocate for a multifaceted view of representation incorporating various scientific perspectives.
- They propose that intentional glosses can be grounded in ecological relationships rather than just neural states.
- The study suggests a new lens for exploring cognitive processes through the free energy principle.

# INSIGHTS:
- Understanding semantics requires recognizing the complexity of language and its relationship to meaning.
- Active inference presents a dynamic view of cognition, emphasizing adaptation over static representations.
- Free energy principle serves as a valuable framework for integrating various cognitive theories.
- Deflationary accounts can simplify complex neural concepts without losing essential insights.
- The ecological context is crucial for accurately interpreting cognitive behaviors and representations.
- Misrepresentation is an inherent risk in cognitive modeling, necessitating rigorous evaluation of theories.
- Intentionality may not be exclusive to humans, prompting reconsideration of definitions of mental states.
- The relationship between neural representations and external reality remains a profound philosophical question.
- A holistic view of representation incorporates both computational and ecological dimensions for understanding.
- Bridging semantics and neural processes could lead to advancements in cognitive science and philosophy.

# QUOTES:
- "Semantics means how we use words and how we make meaning."
- "The vagueness about the term representation is one of the things that the paper sets out to clarify."
- "Intentionality gets quite messy with how vague the word is."
- "Narratives are real like Harry Potter is real; however, everyone has a different reality."
- "The free energy principle is a foundational and axiomatic paradigm."
- "The construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free energy principle."
- "The goal would be to get the best parts of both perspectives."
- "Representational explanations should cohere broadly with actual practices in computational cognitive science research."
- "Representation should allow for misrepresentation, meaning it has to be able to get it wrong."
- "We want the semantic content of the elephant to be an elephant, not just the word elephant."
- "The relationship between mental states and physical states is philosophically profound."
- "We can specify these internal structures in terms of deflationary computational theories."
- "Intentional glosses can be grounded in ecological relationships rather than just neural states."
- "The ecological component is quite important in understanding what the system is doing."
- "This is a different way to phrase mapping relationships between different ideas."
- "Life is going to be locally thermodynamically organizational."
- "The mathematical structures are defined over a state space."
- "The dual information geometry allows us to formalize the ecological relationship."
- "The internal dynamics must be grounded in the ecological context."
- "The mouse is trying to reduce uncertainty about how thirsty it is."
