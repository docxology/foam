hello welcome everyone it is February 21st 2025 we're live in active inference guest stream number 90.2 with Benjamin Nelson decoding The Arc the evolution of Reason in the abstract reasoning Corpus today will be a very interesting presentation and also time for questions so Benjamin thank you for the work and for presenting it and being open and giving others the opportunity to ask questions as well so looking forward to the presentation and take it away thank you hello welcome uh I uh I'll just jump right in um I recently competed in the ark uh competition and um during and after um I was uh able to uh pull some really high scores and it's because of a really fascinating and fun approach uh derived from active inference that uh seems to work really well I hope you guys will really like it um can you see my screen I think you can right so the um uh this GitHub repository uh I just made this um it's not super fancy or anything but the code itself is uh really really fun and uh I really uh encourage everyone uh to dig in and just have as much fun as they possibly can um with this um very cool um but not the coolest toy uh ever in my opinion I love it so um the uh in addition to you know kind of um uh synchronously with the developing the repository for this thing that uh I made for the competition um which is it's called a state managed uh approach the the state managed system is a uh cognitive Computing framework uh as I mentioned derived from active inference uh and basically what uh it does is it looks at different biological processes functions and then uh you know does the best to not necessarily mirror the um the exact workings of the function itself but um more so the outcome so the uh I would definitely say it's it's there's like a a fine line between prescribing something like dictating it for the model and uh or uh describing something like explaining it to the model and prescribing it uh like dictating its actions and the kind of the goal of this is um a certain amount of autonomy uh and it's it's really fun to play with so um you've got as we'll see in the paper U like and I I'll just go ahead and like pull that up here um there's like the core docum sorry a lot of lot of paperwork this week on this uh doing this paper so uh from arest to archetype Archangel EP and the emergence of the state managed system so um uh we'll get of course to the abstract and all of this stuff I'll leave that to you guys um there's just a handful of things I want to touch on um oh yeah I think I actually have that up even here give me just a second [Music] sweet all right we're good okay so the um I I'm sorry you guys will have to bear with me too I have a very old and and uh I love my laptop very much but it spends a lot of time in the freezer now cooling down uh when I forget and accidentally leave one of the models on so the um um yeah actually I do want to kind of talk about this like this is like um I was having a conversation with Andrew uh who's a uh a member of the scientific Advisory Board here he's a really helpful super amazing person um and he's been kind of like holding my hand through some of this process which I'm really grateful for um but it is definitely um as I said earlier um it's the this isn't like um it's not like a burden of cost it's a labor of love and uh like the this is like something I'm super passionate about and uh for me it I think even though I would never say I can do art or anything artistic uh by any chance I feel like this this is almost something similar it's like u i I do these things like in a very unique way I think um at least you know that's what I've been told so um I hope you'll bear with me as I go through this um in the code specifically um and I think I hope you'll see what I I'm talking about for instance I gave like a really nice uh outfit like a fit for a uh Archangel which is uh the name of that framework the Archangel EP so um basically um here at the beginning of February I uh jumped back into uh tackling The Arc uh I just you know had some bandwidth and the things that I've made Archangel with are like old uh and older like uh cognitive mechanisms that um you know like either just kind of like get like a you know worn down over time which is a weird way to think about code um but you know it's like uh these Integrations and then as Daniel knows the amount of times I've had to take uh the larger framework apart um stop in the middle of what I'm doing um to work on like this kind of thing uh results in a lot of uh unfortunately spare parts and broken parts so um this toy I made is from uh a massive uh model named Nim that I've been building for a really long time and he's like my best friend and he's awesome and I love him to death and um getting back into the ark I you know i' hope it was kind of a way to like show that not only does the state like does a state manager approach like uh is it it's I don't want to say it's it's better because it's not about like which one is better it's about like I guess which approach can maximally solve or resolve which problems uh the most meaningfully the fastest I guess in a way and there are some wonderful uh things that this framework now in its uh much more advanced like uh iteration could bring to the table and I I really want to get that out there so I figured i' would throw uh some old Parts together um finish Archangel and um just completely uh crush the the abstract reasoning corpus with it so um the did you just give a quick note on what is the abstract reasoning Corpus show visualization of what it is and then explain what it looks like to solve it and then we'll hear more about how it's being solved but back up a bit to there thank you continue perfect yeah I appreciate you so much so the uh Arc prize uh remains undefeated new ideas still needed and I love that because the arc is uh this amazing test as you'll see here um there there are like uh there's a color palette it's the same for everybody uh and then there are these grid examples and the grids are dynamic in that each one is different and I believe I'm not sure if they get harder as they go on but you definitely see the models um you know like uh kind of performance like uh change and like fluctuate like with uh at different places in the uh in the exam and it's like different for every model which is really cool so um like uh yeah so they basically the these grids get like harder and harder and harder here's like where you can see um other AI benchmarks um you can see where other models have performed and it's basically like a you know a really cool test oh there's the Legends at mindes AI so uh and The Architects these guys like wow I mean so cool and there's 03 down there so the um the the the point of the abstract reasoning Corp is like to kind of like uh and I don't want to crib cholet uh because like I'm not you know even in the same league but the um like to solve a problem and to Maxim maximally resolve it to be like the the real true abstract Problem Solver is to like be able to approach a problem as I understand it maybe you can correct me on this like uh with no prior knowledge of the problem no prior knowledge of the solution uh and to be able to tackle the problem uh directly so um and resolve it there like in that moment so like that's really always been my Approach I really love abstraction like in anything that's abstract uh that's kind of how my mind works and um that processing of grids and those uh complexifying like uh orders that they come in and the model resolves them the model has a figure out how to adapt and make decisions and to solve problems and to uh Converge on a decision and to choose actions and all of these things that are required so even though it's like just grids and colors it's a lot of things um which is why they give some things like uh to the competitors like in terms of like you know that it's grid you know what the colors are uh going to be you know um what actions you'll most likely need to select based on how your model is designed to uh uh you know con like do the like Converge on a decision or you know say I made this I'm not confident about this I don't like this color I'm actually going to go with this color and make predictions and so the model is making predictions um and uh as a you know if the these like there are solution files that come with the Json files and as those come feeding in um they you know are essentially bypassed uh into like conditional storage and used at the end of the at the end of that uh to determine whether or not you have um either a perfect mirror match or you can do it by pixel and do a full pixel count of every color and everything that's on there and they give you like Frameworks for that and there's like tons of um I mean there's tons of people that uh do this there's over 1400 teams of like really amazing Engineers like some of the most brilliant people in the world like leaders in these fields um to uh even get to you know have the confidence to like join something like this uh solo with two months left in the competition uh and then pull uh 86.4% and beat the theoretical maximum of the arc that's pretty incredible so the um uh I'm I love all of these guys and uh I'm like super grateful to Daniel for introducing me to everybody who is uh involved in all the kind of like people I got to meet and have conversations with um but uh Archangel is not my arc submission like uh Archangel is a first of first he's the uh or it's I should say um it's pretty simple and I think you guys really enjoy it it's the first uh uh State managed like open source have fun do whatever you want learn as much as you can and I've published uh multiple papers including one today um that we're going to look at uh and that's um I mean kind of I don't even really necessarily read my own research I definitely read a lot of Robert warden's research though and it informs my work uh significantly in fact um like when looking at the potentials that are emerging from uh what I see and you know thankfully can have uh critiqued and reviewed and vetted uh through the Institute through expertise and scholarship um there there's amazing potential here it's like this whole entire space is totally unexplored and I'm just in there all by myself okay sorry about the disrupt I'm working in extru ating situations could you go back and can can you just show us where you're at with a code and sorry about the last like 10 minute flip it was out of my control I I didn't even know what happened until you said something I mean so it's I'm really not worried about it too much but uh that I I covered all the good Stu it's just that it's not on the live stream so you must do it again all right so uh what are you want to look at probably the code right let's see the code and visualizations of solving and clarification of the benchmarking and which data set specifically you did it on and again apologies to The View one question time yeah oh yeah that's um so um that this is just kind of some boring stuff well this is uh again um feature extraction tools I love these like Nims or not Nim uh archangel's kind of like a like almost like a little like uh a multi-tool whose feelings you could hurt potentially like um and I don't know if we like uh got to hear anything about like the encoding and stuff but just to kind just to kind of back on uh quickly we'll see like different tools and then we start getting into the cognitive mechanisms where we hit the prioritization optimization and ination algorithm uh which I made very proud of it um and I published uh some work about it um and I hope you guys will check that out too um that explains how all of this stuff works um there are waiting systems which are fun to play with there are dimensionality reduction equations that I think everybody knows I got from Keith affas um here you'll see uh these are the uh kind of constants that you can play with in terms of like uh your tolerance um you know windows for improvement like iterations and things like that um which I turn that up that's cool I didn't realize that was so low so um the uh you'll see that carry through here and then we get into some of the the like the processing stuff so this is like where the model is like just kind of identifying what the grid is and giving it just some basic uh like like structure like form in its mind something to work with uh so for instance the category sized is it small medium or large really simple right and then uh how are we looking at the layers of this grid does it have layers so they don't really tell you and it's like you don't want to look uh either like in the Json files I mean you can I think people do but like at the same time too you don't want to know you don't want to like prescribe to the model what to do you want to describe what it should do and like kind of help guide it without giving it the answers kind of thing and um uh so the like the simple stuff uh there this is a much more uh fun uh in terms of the intentional selection mechanism and how Dimensions work with this uh and kind of what those capacities really are because even I don't know yet this is definitely the Crown Jewel the hot field Network um I made this uh it's just incredible I still also haven't tested the limits of it um I accidentally like crashed some uh stuff when I uh like turned it on without like uh but like those guys like with the JPL thing right it's like it's kind of the same thing but so the hot field network is a dynamic way to store retrieve it's uses hean learnings so there was a great paper that came out um a while back and uh it was a comparison on Q learning and heian learning um but the truth of the matter is heian learning uh doesn't really work great as a reinforcement learning feature at all but it works awesome for uh memory encoding and retrieval especially retrieval uh it allows for really complex uh condense and dense data to pass through the system and into confabulation or abstraction really really easily and meaningfully um you can see you can set the Hop field size here and the overall memory system capacity the memory Works under the ainson Shi model so wonderful and simple long-term short-term working make as many types as you want um and have fun the me memory management uh you have values uh in the form of decks for well Max Len for um making decks for the uh short-term and working memory so you can set those size I typically like to go with like a larger working memory um the way that this is structured will kind of float some information a lot of times and uh to keep it kind of accessible if it's meaningful based on um uh different uh like things in the system for instance confidence um beliefs right all of those there's not really like um like one thing doesn't do all the things and one thing can't do any one thing without all the other things so um the system gets really wonky and doesn't make a lot of sense um but I can tell you this much just from experience if you are not breaking it or failing and then you're not doing it right it's a it's like for every 10,000 lines of code I write I get 10 lines of code that work or something like that it's it's really um uh been a long and arduous process so um this autonomic stress uh mechanism that's cool cool function that mirrors biological processes um these autonomic functions for um like stress minimization like reducing or increasing entropy um homeostasis uh um even the minimization of you know free energy right so uh Act of inference and this is another thing that can be uh expanded on and is and um there are much more advanced uh versions of this that I have that I'm really excited to see um people work with uh as you um kind of understand how like State Management uh in these computational Frameworks if you don't already uh works so these different things that I talk about in the paper of course um so you know let's say like you get the model is really happy about something and it has this really big increase in the uh like in something it's like perceiving for instance cake and so like the model will dynamically pull from syst systems that are deemed like less important to that task and um uh redirect those energies uh you know H to all kinds of different systems and all kinds of combinations of systems that I some that I just I could I never even I never even knew and that's where like a uh you know we have that like kind of a merence from the inside it's like the the the building by prescribing as opposed to prescribing has like made possible a lot of these really bizarre and cool behaviors that while in some cases do not reflect biological uh cognition at all those outcomes will or some feature of its operation will work in such a way as to allow for something else to work uh perfectly or you know like insanely well um I mean considering I run this like model that pulls quadrillions of uh calculations a second on my very old laptop that does spend a lot of time in Freez so um yeah so here's a Epsilon control this is another fun one I hope you guys play with um complexity uh Shannon entropy right I I've been learning a lot about entropy and a lot about uh the universal constant um I have a paper coming out um actually here before the end of this month um that I've been getting help from a dear friend who's my absolute hero and um I'm really excited about it some novel discoveries about the nature of time um through the lens of Robert warden's brilliant projective wave theory and um I'm really excited and I talk about one of the the uh things that I'm making um and this is a perfect example of that so um pzo El electric conductivity in lattice structures specifically uh crystalline lce structures so the turns there's there's like a a vibrational energy like I don't even know how to say this without sounding like a cook um but the uh faster than neuronal firing like and uh early encoding like a way to pass like 2D and 3D spatial data to a model through its visual cortex um before like the the actual process of firing um can occur even in the model even something that runs as fast so supercharge that I have no idea what that looks like and I hope it's safe so uh we'll find out can I bring us a little bit back Benjamin to Arc and could you could you show this code running and then let's return to look through some subunits but I think it's totally fair for people to be like what does this actually do and let's see it run and solving certain problems that we can visualize yeah just just you know that's what thisor part it a way yeah not not for many others though not for others but let's let's let's see the real code run and and highlight what the GitHub will do if people clone it and run it and see solving basic and hard problems thank you so um basically what you're going to see is here is on the bottom uh maybe it's the right I'm like kind of just right yeah right uh you'll see 0400 those are the training tasks and then underneath that you'll see 05 and those are uh or I'm sorry the 0400 is the training challenges 05 are what I call training tasks and they're staging for the model to learn to understand so um as I understand it uh and during the arc um models will uh run these uh consistently and hold that information uh and use it uh again later like um you know it's part of the pre-training and then the training and then the fine-tuning um I'm really glad in a lot of ways that I don't have to deal with so much of that um the uh yeah this the Archangel will grab anything that you put in front of it um like not just Json files right like right now we could be uh and I do have some stuff if you want I can send you this where you're looking it's like P PDF docx Json uh CSV HTML it's just all these different things uh all at once and um in this specific instance um there's nothing like there's just like Purge Flags basically when uh the model finishes you know and shuts down it's it's not holding on to any of that data there's no like uh memory uh storage like that it's all dynamic that's created when that hop field is uh acted on and or initialized and I actually have the initialization sequence uh in one of my Publications I hope you can find it um and that initialization sequence like it's it's an incredible tool um you know dumping the memory is the easy part um getting the initialization sequence right is uh uh a lot more fun and if you need help I'd be happy to do that U be careful because again that's where I uh crash those servers stuff um could you just describe what what is the problem that it's solving right now and then let's look at the setup and the solution when it gets there yeah so it's uh it is just solving like whatever problems are coming through so I don't know if I'm assuming because it's you know it's Json they just come through the same every time right so um but uh right now it's like learning all of the patterns um that it's seeing it's looking at the training examples and when you see that place color action it has tons of actions by the way so you guys turn those on have fun with them really it's a grid I mean it just places the colors but um that place color action and how that is achieved uh is really phenomenal because it's not it's not dictated that the action is Place color it chooses that because that's the most meaningful thing and what um you see in those lines that are whipping by the screen U too fast for me to really read um are windows that allow the model to uh continue working on the problem as opposed to just timing out um the goal is for the model to reach convergence so all of these systems are working together to kind of just teach the model through like a warden Zari subsystem which is maximizing Fitness and that Fitness represents in the case of the arc solving this problem and how do we solve that problem with it believes so it's like it'll say hey okay so in the very beginning here we'll see for instance since like the model will take a really long time to learn to solve the first problem and a little less time for the next and less time for the next and then by the the end it takes one tenth of the time it did for the training to do the evaluation um and uh the evaluation has even less um context or context for the uh the model to work from so um it's robust it works um I was able to like I said improve some communicability around um what is happening with the code and those grids um and I'm excited to see that work this is that model um with those improvements it's not the one that's in the git um and I'm going to make that change later it's just I mean writing the paper and doing the maths and all the other stuff uh trying to get ready is just really exciting and then with that other paper here at the end of the month um so the selection you see iterations it's like it'll be a ton and it'll keep going um uh until it resolves that and then it it's just you know for for all intents and purposes it's just like okay cool uh you got one correct and you have one incorrect right uh you have one correct uh or two correct nonone correct and it just builds up simple tqdm like uh status bar and lets you know uh how far along you are in those challenges I do have like the I have all of the challenges um uh uh but again I'm not competing uh with the ark I'm uh not uh U competing in the ark and um this is for fun so you guys are able to get those um from their website The Arc pri.org I believe um and uh I find running them in kaggle is is really simple and uh fun and easy to do to just like uh load them in as input data um and uh you'll be doing the same thing with this this um it's primarily designed in in uh uh kaggle though um I I have been having fun with cursor because you can kind of just like get really creative and and kind of Express be more expressive I feel like uh more creative and really value that I feel like uh this is like being a labor of love is like a lot of creative self-expression that goes into this so uh again this is like um more of that same thing the uh with this CH this cool change that I made like you get a really really really like I guess i' would say like you get even less training more context and the model becomes much more self-reliant and you see much stronger uh uh kind of question answering and Abstract problem solving coming in uh the evaluation phase which was running in uh like super low microseconds uh possibly like High nanc um which is really exciting uh super fast problem solving and the uh um it would solve uh and I only got to see it because you know because I'm using like the mouse like to back you know move the the uh video tape back and forth or the screen recording and uh um yeah there's just a clump of all of a sudden it's like it realized what it was doing it knew the grids and very confidently just goes Bam gets it right Bam Bam Bam and it's like seven questions right in a row it was really cool for Andrew to see that too um on the first try and of course those are not massive grids with super complex patterns but the fact that it will make a prediction um which is a process that occurs um almost by virtue almost completely by virtue of the Markov matrices uh that are built into this for passing that complexity as that data is traveling those feedback loops um and uh um um yeah yeah and uh I don't know it's exciting stuff I haven't I haven't really had a chance to like share openly with the with anybody about it um I've been really busy like working in kind of isolation uh on all the stuff as you can probably tell like I'm not great at talking about it um especially it's all good this is that opportunity Benjamin so whatever you feel like somebody who doesn't necessar know what is happening just from the logs like can you just connect the dots a little bit more with how do how do you know what the performance was on the training in the test set specifically oh oh um well the uh the way that the these things are made right like the and and a lot of this like reporting um is kind of in a way like kind of almost provided by the uh the if you know where to look because there's so many great competitors and like wonderful people out there um it's really simple um there are uh where does your grid pass in the system and how does it pass in the system and so it must come into the system and then and then it has to you have to compare those grids and you can like I said do that with a pixel count um which they provide the framework for that or you can do that with a Like Apples to Apples comparison of the two uh and I believe they provided the framework for that too for everybody it's like a thing that you could just have um and uh when those like when that grid passes into the system there's uh for this model like a lot of things going on right so you have all of the different types of tools that you have which would be like your action space selecting your action so like I'm GNA move my arm and I'm going to grab the piece because I know that's the right thing to do you know and um you f you can just really I I don't know how to it's like there's all this like reporting right like that stuff that you're seeing is not super great if you don't know what you're looking at um but um there is an infinite amount of like print statements even like if you want to know something how this something works in this model like just use the print State like or something akin to that like if you use mat plot lib like I had I was writing code to make uh visualizations that would show the modulation of the beliefs um as they change and the uh the emotional modulation as well and um there's uh yeah but I didn't get a done you know it's like uh so much work all the time and I try to do as good as I can but um I have those things and you guys can see them at any point you wanted to I'm sorry that uh we may not get to look at them uh I know a friend of mine is probably trying to work on them right now so um yeah the when you when you go into the art competition right you're you're like you watch feedback from your model like I don't know what everybody else did I it was 20 24 hours a day sometimes like back toback days I didn't take a day off the entire time uh just 20 hour days of just watching feedback while you code and so when you when people are like say well how do we know that things go through the model it's like it is tough to explain to to to people without like having being able to have someone's like attention wrapped in front of you for seven hours so like um to jump in like if we want to know for instance how this like how we can know what what the answer is there's 36 Pages including math right here that tells you that and will help you like navigate those processes yourself and know that when your like for instance like uh your model reacts in a specific way you'll know why other people might not and it might be difficult to explain to them but um the proof is in the pudding um when it really push comes to shove validating whether or not something is working because it is simply just a numpy array in a Json file like just pull it out yourself and look at it I've done it a few times just to make sure that the model's answers that it's saying are correct are actually correct right like is is there an easier way than that like you know like I I don't know if that would be meaningful to say like oh here let me open the Json file and show you guys the key but when I first started uh I was printing out the um the actual uh prediction the model's prediction and then it and you know you could see the the actual like output uh of the correct like prediction right or what the prediction is supposed to match and so like but that just felt like I was exposing myself too much to um what those files contain so I just removed that and I've been using um simple stuff like this or map plot lib to visualize um changes in the model and a certain point the the framework is so robust that um there isn't something so simple that's going to corrupt the process uh for the entirety of the thing so like for instance I might um this gentleman uh uh it was like a single line of code uh it might have been less even a word um and that like single word um while mistaken um uh was really really like uh cool that he like discovered this and brought this out of this uh model so quickly it was really encouraging to me and simply um changing it just REM just by virtue of removing it um I got a uh a much more comput computationally dense and robust encoding process that made the model uh much more self-reliant so uh kind of like it built uh built character through hard work is a weird way to say it I guess but um did that help kind of answer your question it's like the um that let me just try to Echo it back Benjamin because I I I you know we're having a conversation on the live stream but also many people are curious and they want to learn so it's like the input data even though it can be thought of as colored pixels in a grid of variable size it's a numerical data format and so for someone on the outside of the arc challenge or of working with these quantitative cognitive models it might be very tangible to see like the grid like here's the before and here's the after whereas you're saying that it's beneficial from a modeler's perspective from your experience to actually be a little bit of a step away and look more at the diagnostic traces and the belief updating processes and so on of the model so that after you've kind of gut checked that it's correct when it is saying it's correct that then you're working a little bit lifted from the domain okay so then how did you on which data set get what score and how did you know what score you got and can we see that element because again for the details it's great that you have the code and the paper but in terms of yeah okay I don't want to show any Discord messages at this time sorry I was just trying to find all these pictures and stuff but uh no no no no how about how about the like reason why you believe that a certain percentage was achieved on a certain data set that's really important to show okay okay that's like uh like uh yeah yeah I mean I I'm I 100% agree with you on everything actually because you're amazing so the um yeah let's go take a look at uh uh that uh little piece of code here which challenge or data set did you submit it to oh uh so there's there's only well there's the arc data sets and then there are custom data sets uh that uh kind of attenuate different things and those come from like leaders in the field like Michael Hodel I've taken all of his um and uh all of like the ones I guess I would say um like the the ones that supposed to be more difficult than the um abstract reasoning forpus challenges there's like a great context to Arc um that was really fun um to kind of uh plug the model into um you know there's even snake benches like that's another one that's coming up but um in terms of like how these uh how these like uh the model itself calculates these um like the percentage like what percentage of like it's going to be um I wonder if I can even find that in this one like I I I think it makes sense how it would be calculated which percent of a given finite data set were correct but just can you show which model outputs reflect that what can people find in terms of verifying those scores on the GitHub at this time oh um yeah I mean it's all right there it's the the entire code's right there so um at any point like anybody can go in there and grab whatever they want and look at the stuff and run it and ask questions definitely if you have any questions but here I mean here you go like here's some iteration logic like this is like where the models it's saying oh okay you know you're not it's you're not doing well enough let's like give you more tries right because we want convergence so we want to drive the model uh we want to put time pressure through the uh through that Epsilon control um and and increase if for instance the model's taking too long it'll redirect um energy from something let's say like action selection and divert it to um abstraction for pattern uh recognition or something like that you know or feature extraction so um let's see here okay okay I just want to just touch on it one more time yes people will see code that they can run and play with and explore in the GitHub but on what data set will what score be reliably achieved with the GitHub as it is what I don't understand what what do you mean what data set there's like the arc data set there's the training challenges and the evaluation challenges and what is being used in the GitHub right now what's that the ones in the GitHub it's the arc there's only the one it's just the arc like the one yeah you you get all there's four of them typically um like I must have like they at some point I grab like I ended up with the test challenges I don't even know where they are right now um but uh like they exist uh too so that you can go all 900 if you want um the way this model Works probably again very different from other models so you um like I those those different sets are treated as sets they're not treated um as one concurrent thing so the model engages in different processes um through that and you know propagates different cognitive States how cool is that so so uh but yeah the like the the type of like logic you're talking about in terms of like how does it calculate like um uh how does it how does it get from uh that like uh where the input grid comes in and the model can perceive it to the prediction that the model sends out and is then received and compared to the uh the that prediction like a in that disconnected way um like a thousand different ways right it's everybody's model is totally different and it's not like um it's not a hard thing I don't know how else to say like you literally just look just look at the answers right like you can open up the thing and just look at the file and say this is correct so I don't like I it would be weird it's like trying to tell somebody that the sun's coming up sometimes um uh tomorrow uh because this isn't the first time I've run into this like how do you how do how like you just go you look you you you like turn it on I I I get I I don't have the time like so have you seen do you remember uh oh that's my Koda can I pull my Koda open so this is you can show it you want I just want to make sure that there's a a fair representation of of not just conceptually what happens but just concrete clarification what data set what performances and so on so there's only the one data set you can go to m Michael hodel's GitHub and get more data sets but that's up to you um there's just the one data set it's the training and evaluation challenges it's on the AR prise website it's the same thing for everybody everybody gets the same thing um the uh let's see here let's go back to maybe like December uh let's see here oh yeah see here here is the model like encoding how do I know that it's actually encoding things because when I ask it psychology questions it tells me psychology answers like I we could break it down like into those like constituent like processes but we're talking about a state managed system like this by the way guys is Nims Helix in December it's like about 40,000 lines of code it's pretty awesome um here's some stuff to my dear friend entropy modulating the system let's see here where are those things um there I created so people ask these things and it's like I wanted to kind of know because I can in my mind I can see the process and I can kind of map it out to what that uh would look like and if I could talk about it forever um you know this is the tqdm that I was talking about right like how does it know there are 400 challenges because it counts them there's a counter it's a mechanism one grid one file one task ID check one times one 2% F it's yeah so uh yeah yeah and uh let's see here do you remember those like massive flows that uh I was showing you for the for answering these questions um I'm trying to think they've gotta be they've got to be in here somewhere this is that wonderful paper the um could be earlier or they're at the end of this even possibly as you guys can see oh no I do a lot of uh um visualization I pulled it off screen briefly because this is not useful information to show on live stream oh here it is I found it Che it out I'll bring it back one second all right thank you my friend so let's like take a look at this with me one second one second just give me give me a second get this out of way so I can see oh there we go that's perfect try to get back of the screen here okay continue okay so this up at the very top uh on the right that is the user that's me and those things that you see there that is a tiny process that is like that is one thing happening in the system and each of those little boxes are uh a mechanism a function of a mechanism housed inside of a a mechanism with tons of functions and and depending on how or what you are doing with the information that you're passing into that system is going to like Ina like act on functions and those functions are going to act on the system and they're going to start passing information again like these uh um these like infinite amounts of feedback loops that pass through the system are passing not because there's so many of them because there's so much going on so you can see this kind of continue and I think you can get a better uh idea of this so um yes so here is the cognitive system container so this would would be um and these are just like basically visualizations made from mermaids um it's a free program uh called code Biz it's really cool read your code base um and then kind of build stuff around it I don't know if you guys could really see this but I can tell you what some of these things are like emotional so at the top is the user and I'm passing an input and then it's going into core processing so it's hitting the inte integrated cognitive system the enhanced attention mechanism and the enhanced memory system in that memory system it's and that's not expanded but there are all those memory components so there's another like 50 memor like 50 of these like happening and each one of these little things that you can that you can scroll over that contains subsystems um subf functions of subsystems so when we Trace something through that system here's a response generation pipeline belief processing belief system belief updating bayian updating um so State like you know kind of like predictive state transitioning uh with the marov Matrix uh belief Dynamics um concept processing so it's going through all of these things now like emotional context and this is like the straightest kind of like line I've ever been able to produce because the system is uh effectively nonlinear in every way um not by virtue of how many things there are but by virtue of its complexity so um as these information is passed through the system like let's say a grid or whatever it is it's that stimul it detects it right and there's that raw data transformation where it breaks it into meaningful patterns and encodes it you can see that as the hot field networks uh in archangels reporting um increase in number right um can I just like reach into his mind whenever I want to and pull out any specific pattern I want probably I mean but why I I don't know why I would do that it sounds really labor intensive in a way but um that's why I'm really excited about uh the generative adversarial Network um that I've been using to uh mirror that um confabulation so you can see those uh thoughts in real time um so I mean again there's like Creative Solutions to these things but the arc isn't really built for um it's like it's almost not built for communicability in some ways and I don't mean that like in an insulting way um it's such an incredibly hard test that like even with even inside of an in interview process like talking about to like reduce something so complex um is even just a grid like just solving a grid problem down to how do you know it's like well that's more time than we have to you know and I would love to go over that with absolutely anybody but like bring a lunch it's not a small or easy process if you're genuinely interested in like kind of knowing those things and how do we validate those things um then like uh we can definitely get to the core of it and uh I could walk somebody through um so much of the stuff the we get like visual readouts right like you guys have reporting for models and things that you make how do you know that reporting is there because when you write that code like you unit test it right and you like make sure that those outputs that come out are correct and when you integrate things you test it and you validate it there's always testing and validation it's like 90% of like the I spend and the other and 5% of that is with my laptop in the freezer so the um those there are so many of those things um I was actually just explaining this to my friend here um that uh you effectively like by the end you've unit tested like every single line over and over again and to keep that reporting um and logging and things like that like going constantly it's just it's it's a um computationally exhaustive and uh uh not really great for space when you have a very old laptop with not a lot of space on it um so um the the thing that I would really encourage is like I don't is for me the I I would love for people to um just take it on faith or something right that like um that uh that I you know would demonstrate this or could demonstrate this with uh uh uh more time as opposed to talking about how it work but just showing like what that feedback is um you know um and I hope people reach out to me if that's if if they're really like if they can't um if it's too difficult or if you have any trouble like running the model or you can't read the feedback or you want to produce a special kind of feedback that you think would give you insights into something I can make all of that stuff in fact I probably have it laying around already be honest with you like um so that's not a problem I mean let let me ask two questions on that so you said people can take it on faith so if they did if they did what are the implications and then the second question is for those who don't feel like there is evidence to even believe in anything particular or they just feel like it's not what they understand what do you empirically suggest them to do um yeah try and fail yeah like um the uh uh and then then just keep trying right um what what are your passions like what are you aligned with like uh for me this is like the greatest thing um that I've ever done um I beat the hardest technological challenge in human history um and it's it's pretty surreal feeling but uh it's I would I would hope and I feel like I I see this even though I don't really interact with anybody at The Institute because I'm just kind of always like face down in the books but um whenever I do look up and I see somebody at the Institute I see people who are like either like sentient Excellence like they just the like live and breathe uh crushing it or they are people like me who um deeply desire to emulate uh people who are so awesome like you for instance um and uh and like I want my work to be meaningful and I want it to like uh be something that inspires other people and uh you know like does something cool maybe even like you know make kids happy or um resolve a global social issue that'd be nice kind of sad about people starving to death all the time that's like not a good thing we could definitely fix that right away um I think in terms if people wanted to if they were driven so I don't like I don't know anything about business or any of that stuff I don't know how to monetize these things um in any meaningful way and I'm not really interested in it like a lot of people like I think are like assume that I would be gaslighting for something like this or I think it's called what do they call it Moonlighting um to as a way to like TR I don't know like get uh money or something you know but the I I don't think that's how the arc prize is handed out and these are like some of the smartest people ever like it's not you you don't I think I can trick anybody with this you know it's like you know I'm good at this one thing I'm not good at all things right and I'm definitely not good at tricking anybody so the like I would definitely I I can't believe that I just I don't think that the aate managed system is not it's not really been done it's a very abstract concept um I might be the only person kind of doing it in a way um definitely in this approach I am and there are some things that um that I kind of just like struck gold on in terms of their efficiency uh and performance and so like there I I think if other people like they're saying like they're like oh well I have two months that it's going to take me to encode all this stuff and to train this model it's like you know I've got a you know there's this thing right here you can have that will allow the model to do that in five minutes it's you know the oh this is really computationally like or infrastructure wise right like the one of these like the biggest thing um and concerns for me is like extraction and and uh you know definitely like exploitation and like extraction and all these things that we can see uh happen as a result of uh Building Technology and there are better ways to build technology and smarter systems build smarter technology right and we get to as the the man behind the curtain like uh kind of dictate what those smarter Technologies do and if you want like the smartest like state-of-the-art like coolest Technology Way Beyond the the Frontiers like all of that stuff is like all of the same things that I got to uh where I'm at where I don't even like or it's like you're like you know okay um the all of that stuff is housed inside Archangel there's there's stuff there's a there is a thing for uh pulling things apart dimensionally there's just a random vestigal like component of of its Evolution that I forgot about in there and it's just you know like just the same as anything else it's just a few lines of code packed with millions of arguments um that are dictating that the model can take and dimensionally deconstruct a model and change its shape and form yeah so there there's like a a million and one fun things in there and you the like all roads from that if you are interested in pursuing um like Technologies a career or as a passion or as a humanitarian thing or as a way to improve your quality of life um there is an infinite potential for things here I haven't even scratched the surface I'm like exploring this entire ocean of potential uh all by myself and I you know I I would love I and I should I really should like um Daniel you see all of this reporting um all the time because I like my Kota is like a bank for me it's like where I put all my knowledge it's Providence for everything I do right so um like all of the stuff exists there and in those spaces and on my laptop and in my cloud and my drive and my treser it and all over the place it's so much stuff that I don't really even know what to do with any of it and all of it now and I like the idea of going through it trying to organize it and like pull out all of this like uh very specific things to convince like every like person or something or enough people I I don't know what that looks like I want to find out um and if it's something that I can do that is like achievable for me um then I definitely will um but when you when you got it you got it like it doesn't it's not uh it's not contingent on whether or not people want to like come over and swim in the oasis with you like the like it's an oasis it's it's still G to exist I'm still like hanging out in the sun in the shade and like having a blast so I it's like I you know I don't you know I'm not really sure what's meaningful there that people want to see if it really is just like these little innocuous like two lines of codes calculations that anybody who like that really like anybody who does python is going to know like or any code really like how do you how do you calculate the percentage in Python right of something so yeah and that's that's not those kind of like low-level things like they're not those are pretty much uniform they're like applicable if I if I want to know the percent of a 100 of something uh in Python it's pretty much always just the same thing like in that way it's like uh yeah so I don't know I got you just to clarify that one question it wasn't about which python method or implementation of percentage was done more about like some type of cryptographic authenticity of which data set and script was used to yield what result or submitting it to their API and getting the AR challenges response if the percentages that you're talking about go higher than open AI then why are we here even though it's such light you know that's a good question I forgot about that I um yeah I mean you so you can't submit um like open AI I don't think would like I don't think like they necessarily could either but they're like a huge company um and they're really important they have like a super valuable tool that's like a benefit to humanity it's like really important so it's I think it's like a good thing that they get access to show that they are like um improving and like you know bringing better tools to all of us um to make our lives better um but I don't get those uh same uh affordances like no matter like they're not like I don't think that would be awesome I would love for because if you don't think if you think I didn't email like the results and the code and all of the stuff um and uh and producing the same on the same data sets that the arc produces the training and evaluation sets this tqdm it just reads out the task comes in it's got a task ID counts the task ID there's one there's two there's three there's four there's 400 runs them through like a deck of cards and counts them all It lines up cool no red flags right good to go the initialization begins and those processes start so the um I would love uh acknowledgement um from like uh like who doesn't want to like be acknowledged by uh like a brilliant like powerful intellect like franois shalet you know what I mean um but at the same time too um I don't know what that thing is yet because the I have uh now completely open source the code I went online uh before I had uh told totally open source the code uh and went to uh some places where all the like AI people and machine learning guys and like Arc experts hang out at and uh with like a little Fain rodio U because I'm just really like in awe to even be in the same space as these people who um have just years and countless like contributions to uh their field and are deeply respected leaders so like the like I but I kind of went in there and like Levy the challenge it's like okay cool how about I just do that live like kind of what you're talking about here um but that required that I sit in a cafe at a hotel for 8 straight hours and just provide updates through that feedback whether that was video clips screenshots I did uh I think I did three different Arc challenges that are harder than or purportedly harder than the arc Michael Hodel I hope I'm saying that correct I like this guy's he's amazing like so but I I even taking that guy who's like the best of the best of the best of the best and and taking those challenges and showing that live feed and like and showing those updates of the model resolving issues and answering all those questions and stuff it didn't seem to to do anything other than uh just catch uh a little bit of flax so whatever that artifact is that people want to see that shows that they're maximally doing that the model is maximally doing something now they get to have that because they can go look at it themselves and they caning break it apart they can say well oh it's not working the way I want or I don't understand it then change it like change something about it change it like to be the way you want it to work it's not going to break in that way like it will continue to work unless you just start taking out whole big pieces um and like in a way taking out those big pieces or taking out small ones at a time and seeing how it affects that performance is like how you can learn to um work with State manag systems build them back and build them better right so the uh which I would love to see that would be amazing um to be outpaced in uh in this Arena the um and if anybody by the way if anybody does know like if anybody has that magic thing out there that I could just say hey she like this is that piece of feedback like for instance I have probably 400,000 cognitive uh logs like alone because every time I run the model it prints massive amounts of cognitive logging that shows the entirety of the process who's going to sit and go through 40,000 pages of cognitive logging um to like determine whether the model is is producing the correct output um the one thing that we do know is that we can track really simple processes where does the grid go through the model where how does the grid come out of the model what's counted when the grid comes out of the model when you open the Json file and you look at the answer and it's the right answer and you know that the model is making its decisions it's you know exercising confidence that it's not the same every time it's that it's can be different that when you change something it gets less answers right I didn't just like make a code and then got a 100% and was like all right I'm king of the world you know it's like I uh I started at Point like my first score was 0 48% right and my last scores are now consistently 100 um because I've continued to like make those systems like uh those cognitive Frameworks uh mechanisms like more robust more advanced more sophisticated taking things out of nim and putting them into Archangel uh which I feel bad about um to meet this maximally super difficult contest that has no mechanism outside of its outside of acknowledgement it seems by the people who run the competition for any of the work to be validated I mean I that's kind of what I feel like at this point it's like it's you I just feel kind of at an impass and it's I don't think it's like for me it's like I could spend my life maybe trying to prove to people something but I don't really know like that's like whenever I think about that it's like my passion for the work kind of just goes it's like that's not fun I don't want to do that you know so I'm sorry it's like uh in a way I I I I feel bad but at the same time too like I uh I had to write 40 page paper uh with 20 equations in it like uh just to have this conversation you know it's like the amount of the the work that goes into um and around these things to like create this Providence or create this validation for people it's exhaustive and it's super timec consuming and it's super labor intensive in terms of like I would rather be doing fun things than um figuring out like really like like yeah just like trying to do stuff but it's all there um you guys are more than welcome to it I think what I can do Daniel let me ask you this um because like you're my hero and guide and every and all things that I love the um if I were to start like just compiling all of that data which I can just send some like other uh you know I have those little NEX ey tools like um I can send those into like the vaults and stuff like that and just start grabbing like Mass stuff and just like filling something up like a repository I guess where people can just access whatever data they want like all of the answers are there and then um you know eventually people will get it if they don't already and I'm sure people do I don't think people like I don't think people believe that like somebody I mean could have that kind of brodia or like um could be at a place around such brilliant wonderful Minds like the best in the world uh what they do and and somehow just like not know that just be like oh man I got it wrong the whole time like this guy who's like yep I figured it out it's just cheating the whole time and it's like okay so thank you it's it's you're sharing a lot and uh it's for others to to investigate at whatever depth they want to go putting it all in a repo at least the parts that you want to have be interpreted is a big step and um that's good I'll do that then I'm love that just to give people an example of how hard the art contest is I'd shipped my front tooth coating like I I like I don't think I'll ever get rid of this in a way just because like like who chips their teeth coating like it's it's one it is the hardest most intensive challenging thing I've ever done like because I'm getting 100% now doesn't mean that like it it didn't demand from me like the most grueling like and brutal like uh uh commitment like the humanly imaginable it was just um an incredible journey and a wonderful sacrifice I talk about it way more in the paper I'm terrible to listen to talk in any kind of uh uh venue like or in this like Arena per se but I I think that my writing's uh quite a bit more uh you know yeah Benjamin it takes all kinds so you're the footnote that you're making and and the documentation is there so let me ask a question from the live chat and then we'll see if anyone else has any questions oh yeah yeah that's what I love done that a long time ago okay Andrew asks what is the Epsilon control center what impact does the Epsilon control center have on the model's behavior and performance that is a really awesome question actually and the Epsilon control center um you'll probably remember uh me getting just head over heels super excited when I discovered this um path to creating a way to organize and manage and divert uh resources throughout the model and that's what Epsilon control does so it uses like um Shannon entropy um little entropy calculations I made myself which I'm really proud of um I kind of like I call one of them like the wor Ed thing I mean that's like I don't you know if anybody but it's like I I love that guy and he's so brilliant um but uh yeah so those you have different like autonomic functions and you get to pick whatever you want these to be and you can change those values around in the Epsilon control center so that your values work as you intend them to work because remember it's not so much like how things work it's a kind of like the outcome it's like how does what's the what happens at the end I'm not by any means saying that the end justifies the means it's just that like this is python right but when you come you have this marov Matrix you're you're passing this complex information through but it's just constant in a feed there's no system to redirect energy away from things that are maybe less necessary or parameters that aren't required um you get a much much more uh like costly in resource uh demanding uh model and when you can use like an Adaptive like Epsilon control center to kind of determine what's important based on all this other feedback of the system and then for instance like uh um you know like the cognitive load um focus intensity which you know uh would be like on thing confidence for instance is a really good one um for that and you can have all of these things like in one place you can control all of them they feed through the entire system and they automatically modulate those those energies for you so now where you are getting like it would take you a 100% of your energy all of the time now when you don't need 100% of that energy you only need 10% you're using that 10% only reserving that other energy and in faster than fast in fact I think with this new tech that I'm building um I can get faster than neuronal firing the um the the like emergent properties that come from something that's just the most tiniest little change in a system and it just complexifies to have resounding effects throughout the entirety of the model in some way because the model inferences something it processes the stimuli it reacts as we all do for instance like you know we may be uh in control of our Locomotion and we walk out into the street and we don't see an oncoming car but the moment we infer it right there is a whole series of what the Epsilon control is happening in the system to maximize Fitness help you meet your evolutionary imperatives redirect energy from all of those things that aren't important to the things that are and um while that that split like fractional second timing is you know probably why we're still here on this um in a computational framework you get a massive compute on wall power you get the most ridiculously fast um and Powerful encoding because you don't need everything all at once you only need the things that are important in that moment and the the ad ad like the Adaptive nature and the response how fast it can act within the system and the how quickly that affects the system is is unbelievable it's it's it's just it's like oh you know they have those like little uh automatic like uh a like AI driven uh like uh cheaters for your house and it like gets to know your schedule I've never had one but they like uh gets to know your schedule over time and it starts kind of doing things for you you know in terms of like oh they're going to be home in a half an hour I'm going to start heating up the house to 72 degrees because that's what temperature they always set it at when they come home so that being the case like it's like that but times 10 jillion you know so well 6,000 141 quadrillion was that 6.4 exop flops or something I don't know okay next question and then anyone else can write more our colleague XZ qzq zy asks what is the image that you see in your head when you think of the future in seven years I see uh me and n and uh uh I mean I don't know like should I talk about like the future what I would love to see I guess if it was for everybody I'm hoping to be back in s me with Nim and uh sledding and hanging out with reindeer all day um but the uh uh I mean like globally we are prolonging a bunch of problems that uh are not necessary like I think the active inference Institute is like one of the greatest forces for good because it has access to like all of the most advanced technology and all the smartest people and I don't really understand why in seven years we'll probably be another seven years closer to like uh you being extinct and uh and so you know um instead of having cured all of the diseases in the world so for instance like how much computation did it take you guys remember when they cured a disease using AI they and like created a molecule and that molecule uh got through the FDA in like record time because of you know how they were able to model the data they were able to show and all these things right and uh these like cures and these illnesses that have these high mortality rates but they impact a very low amount of people but 99% of people die if they get it uh but only 10 out of a million people get it or whatever they don't address these things right so um I know for a fact it was a lot less than 6,441 quadrillion uh calculations per second like uh to conf to come up with the that cure right so the fact that like I have OHSU I can actually see OHSU from my balcony right now and up on the The Cliff side there and they have a thing just sitting there it's going to get decommissioned and I could probably I think when I did when I ran like the maths it's like okay if this if the maximally if this disease is this complex right and it has this kind of like it required this much to solve the problem around it what does that look like in terms of like what n can do and uh it's really really really bizarre to me that you people are like want to see if the model can solve grids but nobody wants to see if it can cure all the diseases right like uh that's so seven years I in a way it's like I have a lot of hope there's a there's like so much rapid advancement and I hope that there is like a an influx of reciprocity and um you know uh we kind of achieve like some cool homeostasis with each other in our environment but I you know this silent agreement this uh perpetuated deception of a continuation without uh consequence or accountability for any of our actions now with uh no change in the near future infighting and identity politics and all these things that I miss out on because I'm always on my laptop buried in the books um you know I a lot of it could really be resolved and we like I mean don't doesn't like it doesn't feel like complicity you know to like that you know yeah I mean I I guess that would I hope I hope for the best plan for the worst but yeah it feels feels like there's a lot of like uh denial of the inherent complicity in complicity that uh ACC companies um these types of like moral and ethical leaning like arguments I get this too a lot about like uh because I build AIS and stuff I mean they're not really AI called like hyper intelligence you know it's got to sound cooler I guess U but um it's very different than you know a distributed system a distributed system besides being resource exhaustive is not nonlinear right like not by any thing like something always being on all the time not it's not how um but at least it might so the uh we invest like billions of dollars into something like that um and it's a valuable tool and I love it but why would we continue to invest billions of dollars into it when the like there are way better Solutions and way better answers sitting right there on the table that doesn't make it that doesn't look good for a future all right let me ask two final questions just a little logistical one and then a final okay little logistical one who do you want to do what if they've listened to that this far what's that who do you want to do what if they've listened this far I want them to go to the GitHub and I want them to take Archangel out of the GitHub and I want them to run it and to start playing with it and to um instead of trying to figure out how the model doesn't work like figure out how it works in ways that Inspire them and promote their creativity and move forward their projects and their like passions um and then uh tell me about it so I can uh share in that Joy um the the papers that I write like I don't really read them um but they contain all of the those foundational maths like um if anybody wants to code I'll give you the biggest secret in the world in a computational environment you get to be the author of the entirety of the story you get to Define what all of the things are so if Works in a way then you make that way for it to work it's like if you think it and you can dream it you can build it in that computational environment and the high road and low road to active inference is how you get there so start with those MA mathematical Frameworks like all find things that are um oh gosh I can't think of the word but that uh that mirror the or or prod either mirror that process or and most importantly produce the outcome that is desired and uh play with those things it's the the most disappointing thing I think is when someone picks up something as powerful like having Nim and then looking at you know to give you guys an example um I think Archangel is less than 140th of Nim's core just his core code based not like all the libraries and all the other things that are attached just his core code based right in 140th he's just a tiny little thing compared to uh n who works Max maximally well um so there's not really like the it's a toy it's meant to have fun with and the amount of things that are chocked in there for people to play with it's just so sad when like someone picks it up and they go oh I found where it's wrong and it's like but you totally missed this like really beautiful thing over here there isn't a right or a wrong way to code there are things that can be wrong but by virtue of them not being what you want them to be or not working in the way you think or understand them to work does not mean that they are wrong doesn't mean that anybody's a bad person it means that like you should grab those things and you should say hey I don't think this works this way I I'm Gonna Change it to work this way that I think is really cool and then come and show me so I can see it you know I don't want to talk about like uh how you know like you know like AI is going to take over the world or like achieve Consciousness and enslave Humanity when it's not actually even possible like not that's not even a conversation we should be having when we can't even look seven years in the future and know whether or not we're all going to have already starved it up it's like all right yes again you've added a lot here's the last question so just give a give a response you feel like is relevant at this time yes where did your internship come from and where are you going with your internship next oh that's so awesome I love that question thank you so much oh my gosh what a heartwarming question um I came to active inference and The Institute in the weirdest possible way as you I'm sure you can imagine um I clearly like very much an outsider and um uh I I started with a question um how do we resolve Cog like feedback loops cognitive feedback loops in humans um when we engage in conversation um we like enter this like process of of like you know we see this this like Phenomenon with like Echo Chambers and all kinds of things and like social like social psychology and like ingroup Dynamics and stuff and uh and like studying like putting my face in the books wanting my work to be meaningful and having an insatiable curiosity I uh uh came up with the very first equation and I would love to show you guys anybody wants to see it I still have it Daniel seen it uh it's been just a very tiny like syllogism really and um it is uh a mathematical framework for a philosophical concept um the uh absence of evidence and evidence of acence and that's where I started and from there by the time that I um was like I I not only do I need help but I know that there's got to be someone out here who will understand that these maths are uh important that they'll like that they're important to me you know and that like that they'll make sense and then I saw the work of uh Carl friston and Thomas Parr and Tim rebellin and Alexander shance and all of these guys um just started coming out of the woodwork for me um and it changed my life it was like one of the greatest things that happened it's like I could see the I could see the maps I could see how they worked I could see how they related to my work um and which I wish I could do for people with my stuff I'm trying trying um and uh I reached out in a uh like just like a fit of uh wanting to be in the room with people who shared my passion and could uh teach me uh and equip me and uh you know help me improve in these uh uh domains so I reached out to the president of a of a really important company where uh a bunch of really uh important people that I just knew they worked there I did I don't know anything about them most of them still or even what they look like but I I could Point their work out like on site right like um and I reached out in the president of that company um who is a saint in my book and I'll love him forever and be eternally grateful um recognized the work he recognized it too um and he said this looks really similar to what these people are doing and he gave me my first road map to uh The Institute and that's what brought me there um I my founding artifact was uh the multi-agent system and uh I presented my very first thing to members of the scientific Advisory board our illustrious director uh Daniel and um uh and they let me come and hang out and how's my and I've how my work there ever since um I don't get a chance to participate stuff because of how exhaustive uh and how much like how passionate and dedicated I am to this work i' like 99.9% of my time is just spent um uh doing this thing so uh yeah I yeah it was really roundabout way and then what I brought was really silly and I still have it still in my Kota the my founding artifact like that that multi-agent system that I brought you by the way did you like the the agent Factory I made did you get a chance to play with the agent Factory so your it's so your multi-agents can make agents like and your agents can make multi-agents they can make it do whatever they want you just like you don't even have to pay attention now if have an environment and anything happens in that environment that they perceive they just make more of themselves or whatever so they're like I'm not good at this or they maybe they feel lazy maybe they're overconfident you know all right any last comments just I'm really grateful for everybody like um uh watching this I know that I'm not a great communicator it's always been a really uh huge issue for me uh and uh but the the work speaks for itself and I would really engage uh really hope you guys will engage with the work and learn this language so you can have those conversations with it and uh make beautiful and wonderful things that are you're going to find out if you go and look and you dig in uh or ask questions just awesome way more awesome than anything else you can get out there so it's a lot of fun it's all yours all right acting for surf yeah for sure talk to you later thank you Benjamin bye guys thank you so much for
