hello and welcome this is active inference guest stream number 91.1 on November 1st 2024 we're with John daglio at all discussing dual aspect monism and the free energy principle we'll have a presentation by John followed by a panel discussion so thank you all for joining and John for the presentation to you okay thanks Daniel and thanks very much to active inference Institute uh for for hosting this uh and and thank you so much to um all of uh my colleagues and uh people I very much look up to and uh uh such brilliant figures in the field for for joining uh for this um so I'm going to be speaking about um the free energy principle and dual aspect monism specifically from a leanian neuros psychon analytic perspective um and I'll say a little bit about what kind of background I'm I'm bringing from from the leanian Viewpoint um it's a particular School of psychoanalysis uh that has mostly engaged less with contemporary Natural Sciences and I think that this engagement is very fruitful and introduces some uh not necessarily new ideas but uh different sort of angles and perspectives and so I'm really much hoping for for a discussion and um around these ideas um but to be to begin with a a joke uh that maybe illustrates some of the ideas um this is actually this is a joke for the hegelian subject um but I think it would equally apply to the leanian subject um as uh the the lenan subject or hegelian subject not as something that is um a simply straightforward uh conscious being but a certain uh uh self-contradiction or a certain self-loop um uh of uh uh uh the diverting out of One's Own Self um and so so the joke goes um that uh the subject emerges precisely by way of a reflective self-relating reapplication of a logical operator as in the worn out joke about the cannibal who ate the last cannibal in the tribe uh so and and uh these sort of um twists um show up in a lot of um the sort of philosophy behind here but I I think that uh the idea is linked quite well um to uh some of the computational concepts that I'll be talking about so with that um these are some of the um sources I'm drawing on this is a book recently published um uh uh I'm very grateful for uh Mark and Carl for um such kind endorsements and um an article that recently came out in the journal neuros pych analysis discussing some of these ideas in a little more specific philosophical depth um but to begin um I I I begin with uh uh SS's work on dual aspect monism and just uh to give the background uh dual aspect monism is a philosophical position um coming from Spinosa where it doesn't uh posit some sort of dualism uh from this cartisian tradition uh rather there's just sort of one stuff in nature um I'm calling it thing in nature um but there's just kind of one thing Freud called it the mental apparatus and the and this is the monism part of it and the Dual aspects come from the fact that we have two Vantage points for this one part of nature you can look at this part of nature uh as a subject um with thoughts feelings and the like and you can look at this part of nature as an object um the brain the thing that you can poke uh squeeze measure all of those things and the idea is that uh neither is more real than the other uh these are two perspectives of the same unique part of nature it's not like the liver which does all wonderful things of filtering toxins out of the body um but presumably there's not something it's like to be be a liver um uh in the way that there's something it is like to be the brain that there is a a subjective experience that the brain has and likewise there's a subjective Vantage Point uh on this uh thing in nature but let me just uh make okay great so these are two uh lenses uh neither is necessarily more real than the other um but interestingly this leaves this kind of question of okay well then what is this thing in nature um how can we describe this thing in nature uh if it's neither uh uh physiological nor subjective what is it then um and recent work um has has argued and tried to apply the free energy principle um to characterizing the the nature of this ontology uh to characterize the nature of nature so to speak and um the argument is that um ultimately uh for any what's called a self-organizing system any system which is bound by a barrier that distinguishes system from not system uh obeys what's called friston's law and friston's law as uh everyone here knows um uh is that um all quantities within the system that can change will change to minimize free energy um minimizing free energy being um a way of saying there's a minimization of uh uncertainty uh there's a minimization of entropy um minimization of error signals essentially and I realize there are some mathematical differences but um this this is the general picture um so the argument is that this thing here uh can be characterized as obeying these sort of informatic principles of minimizing uncertainty minimizing surprise and all of the operations here can likewise be uh characterized as um changing in order to deal with um free energy so that being said um I I I want to take this and and think through um uh Mark SS's recent work on the hard problem of consciousness and specifically his Arguments for what then are the necessary mechanistic features for a conscious self-organizing system so not just sort of things in nature in general but specifically this this part of nature that has this very remarkable quality of being conscious um and how do we characterize this how do we understand it um from a free energy principle perspective and so the first main point is that um within this system there are multiple categories of uh homeostatic demand uh and and here um the the main references are um innate categories of um especially emotional uh homeostasis but not only also bodily homeostasis for example um uh viable bounds for blood sugar concent uh levels for sodium concentrations but also more socio emotional things like it is good for the system to for the organism to be close to caregivers um it is good to avoid threats to life and limb in the prehistoric jungle when the prehistoric tiger is running at the poor prehistoric human the one who has um wants to avoid said prehistoric tiger um is going to survive um it's going to maintain the Integrity of the system uh and so the argument is that within this uh system especially in mamalian brains there are many there are many of these categories um I'm not going to list all of them um perhaps can talk about them later if it becomes relevant but there are these different systems that um are different uh affective uh qualities uh I've mentioned a few um say attachment demands say um demands for engaging with novelty uh say demands or saying uh staying safe from threats to to to harm and computationally speaking all of these systems function as what's called hyper priors or innate prior predictions uh So within the model um these are predictions that one the organism uh is born with and two uh they can't change uh so you can't change your set point for temperature bounds because if you do then you dissipate and proteins don't like that um so and likewise for uh uh these socioemotional homeostats of saying uh it is good to stay close to caregivers um these hyper prior do not change and so the the the system has to deal with them it has to sort of re with the fact of these things um and therefore in the very chaotic context of um uh uh existing um not only in the prehistoric jungle but also in the complicated interpersonal social life that humans especially find themselves in there are many different contexts and more specifically many unpredicted contexts um there's no way that Evolution could have predicted that we'd be living in the current kind of society we're living in that's not sort of ENC into the into the genome um but what this means is that there has to be some mechanism within the brain for prioritizing which um category uh am I going to uh focus on or allow to sort of guide my predictive Cascades in this given context um uh uh in in this given uh situation am I going to follow um hunger predictive Cascades am I going to uh um I might be hungry right now but I'm I'm having some sort of thing I want to say uh so I'm prioritizing something else um when uh uh you are uh holding a hot cup of coffee um but you have a goal of wanting to not spill that because you know that might be frustrating you then you tolerate um the pain that you feel uh from the hot cup of coffee in your hand rather than following the pain Cascade to release the hand and drop it um you are sort of following a different um line of prediction um for for a moment um when the child is faced with uh the conflict of okay my loving caregiving um uh uh caregiver is not doing what I want them to do right now um that's making me a little angry I'm actually feeling like I want to destroy and attack um this caregiver but oh no that doesn't uh line up well with um my demands to stay close and um sort of stay protected by this caregiver if I destroy uh uh the caregiver then there's no one for me to be close to so I have to choose which one am I going to prioritize um uh especially in unpredicted contexts uh within that prioritization is the capacity for Choice um there's the capacity to voluntary um action um at this basis so these five uh uh features are are are what Mark has argued are the sort of core features of um an affectively conscious self-organizing system and it's within this model that I want to think about okay um what uh does the leanian perspective kind of add to this and specifically what how does this uh open questions for thinking about the free energy Principle as we apply it to uh how we think about especially human ontology um within this uh we can say however that all of these mechanisms all of these uh functions that are necessary uh for their to be uh affective Consciousness that sort of subjective quality of uh feeling of what it's like to be uh uh conscious which is a certain kind of feeling State um all of those obey First's law uh that is um uh they the prioritization function operates in order to minimize free energy and how does it do it um this is the the argument that affective Consciousness uh corresponds to Precision modulation so there are not only within the free energy Principle as again we all know predictions and prediction errors these are all weighted by Precision weights basically the the confidence in how how confident am I that this prediction will minimize free energy uh likewise how um Salient are these prediction errors um should I be attending to them or not can I just dismiss them um and the Precision weights um are uh uh uh modulated depending on which which of the uh homeostatic systems gets prioritized so for example to go back to the poor child who has to deal with um conflicts of rage and attachment um uh prioritizing rage adjusts different predictions that are more likely to minimize um the the prediction errors relating to rage the frustrations around that um uh attack uh destroy um uh cry complain um uh uh uh teeth and things like that versus um uh attachment uh prioritizing attachment needs would lead to a different um uh modulation different Precision weights would um be increased others would be decreased that are associated with more affiliative or bonding um Cascades and when it comes to situations of uncertainty where the organism does not know what to do uh the prioritization here allows one and this is uh the the argument for why why affects are conscious or why this Precision modulation is conscious is that feeling one's way through one's predictions it's not just that the Precision weights change that's the sort of what we see um thinking from objectively but when we think about it subjectively this this is just feeling when you feel your way through your predictions you're able to feel okay this feels better good in a certain way this feels bad worse in in a certain way this allows me to sort of feel my way through conditions of uncertainty when I don't know what to do and I have to create I have to explore I have to invent um uh I use affect as a guide uh and this is the the homeostatic function of affect uh and it is in this way that affect facilitates the minimization of free energy in the long term for the system um this idea of feeling one's way through one's predictions uh okay so um thinking philosophically here then what uh what this position argues is that friston's law and the the uh formulas of the free energy principle explain the operations of the mental apparatus that ontological level in both of its appearances in both uh subjectively it explains um the the the qualia and subjective experience of affect affective consciousness and objectively it explains various neuronal Dynamics neuroc Cascades um specifically uh neuromodulatory control of post synaptic gain um via these uh uh or homeostatic uh command systems and what this allows us to sort of try to begin Furnishing I think this is what's so exciting um regarding the philosophy of the fre energy principle is that we can begin to articulate uh what I'm calling an informatic ontology um one that is neither physiological nor um subjective but this something else of what it is it's it's has something to do with information it has something to do with minimizing uncertainty and how we go about dealing with uncertainty okay what does Lan have to do with any of this um and so um Lan uh was a French psych analyst who is very famous for arguments around language uh arguing that um one of his perhaps his most famous argument is that the unconscious is structured like a language and uh this leads to many arguments and Lon was notoriously known and leanians today are even more notoriously than Lan I think known for being remarkably anti-naturalist uh and but this is maybe an illustrative quote uh so this is from an interview I think I I think when Lan was at MIT or I think somewhere in the states um we think with our we think we think with our brains personally I think with my feet that's the only way I really come into contact with anything solid I do occasionally think with my forehead but only when I bang into something uh but I've seen enough eegs to know that there's not the slightest trace of a thought in the brain um this is not the only comment Lon makes like this but it it carries a certain sentiment that um and S sort of background for this audience which I know may not necessarily be leanian um uh but uh leanian PCH analysis is very uh this perhaps characterizes most leanians as sort of not really interested in engaging with the brain that it's simply not relevant what we care about is language um and that's all we care about and it's unfortunate because this really obscures a lot of points Lan made and it really misunderstands I think how Lan thought about language and I think how Lan thought about language is actually incredibly consilient with uh the free energy principle and this idea of information so this is a quotation from Lan commenting on Freud's project for scientific psychology and um this is a drawing of that Freud has there on of the the neurons uh and and commenting on Freud's use of thinking about neurons and trying to think through this attempt to furnish a psychology for neurologists and so on um uh Lan says it is this this idea of neurons that gives value to atomistic theories the latter do not cover any of those things they claim to cover namely um uh a certain number of atoms of the neuronic apparatus supposedly individualized elements of the nervous system neurons again but on the other hand the theories of and relations of contiguity and continuity illustrate admirably the signifying structure as such in so far as it is involved in any linguistic operation so what L is saying here is that these individ neiz elements uh the sort of reductionist one might even say approach of atomistic theories of the nervous system actually illustrate what he is thinking about through the lens of language and Linguistics um I think this is this this is quite um different from saying that it's language per se um and this is a quote from seminar 20 um I say that the unconscious is structured like a language and I say like so as not to say he says all the time that the unconscious is structured by a language the unconscious is structured like the assemblages in question in set theory which are like letters um I'm not going to go into um Lan's um quasi mathematics here uh but the idea here is that um uh what is it the emphasis is on the word like it's not um what language is by language English German whatever it might be um it is what is the nature of language and specifically Lang anguage as differential system ofous and continuous relations um and Lan argued proposed at least was open to the idea that this can be applied to the brain um again when he's commenting on the project in orientation to the object uh the regulation of the threat the uh ideational Representatives relate to each other in accordance with the laws of memory organization a memory complex a facilitation um or a concention and I emphasize here whose neuronic apparatus perhaps allows us to Glimpse those operations in a material form and whose functioning is governed by the law of the Pleasure Principle uh again and I think this is quite clearly showing how uh it's not an emphasis on okay no it's only about language it's an emphasis on okay these um what linguistic operations uh contiguity continuity can be glimpsed and can appear likewise in the operation of the brain I.E the the neuronic apparatus here uh and more specifically governed by the law of the pleasure pleasure principle which um today we can understand as the law of free energy minimization and one last quote from Lan because I think it's so remarkable here um this is again in seminar 20 uh and he's commenting on the on the status of information theory in Natural Sciences at the time in in the early 70s uh and he's talking here that we're at the level of the gene molecular information and the winding of nuclear proteins around strands of DNA that are themselves right around each other double helix and all of that and all of this being tied together and sent via hormonal links in other words messages that are sent recorded and so on let us note that the success of this formula Finds Its Source in a Linguistics that is not imminent but explicitly uh uh formul not only imminent but explicitly formulated in any case this action extends right to the very foundations of scientific thought being articulated as and I emphasize negative entropy um a negentropic function again a resistance of dissipation toward um uh entropy of the of the system uh so even at the level of DNA what Lan is saying is you can see something linguistic here surely there is not speech at the level of DNA in the sense of literal language being exchanged as in what I'm saying right now however it's the logic of communication Theory um that that that is uh relevant here and so what we can say then is that when uh when when the the symbolic or the the the system of language that is referred to uh in leanian theory what this refers to is some kind of linguistic organization a relation of different elements um uh uh uh that are uh continuous uh in a chain uh ones that relate to each other ones that um are anticipatory one anticipates the next um that revolve around a certain antagonism contradiction or inconsistency and this is where um the particular leanian twist I think comes in it's that and this is what Lan means by the real that um within any symbolic system whether that's actual spoken language or um the systems of DNA communication um or um the neuronal atomistic elements um within the brain that there's some uh inconsistency some uh tension that prevents a perfect settling of the system it prevents a a full sort of uh uh uh resolution uh where there where there would be no let's say uncertainty where there would be no uh antagonism or attention or arousal um and importantly this inconsistency is not some rued or imperfection to be remedied or healed or done away with by um uh good enough adaptation by um a correction or sort of thing it's it's something that's at the core of one's being and Lan terms this this neologism extimate condensation of exterior intimate external internal um uh and the idea is that what is most foreign to us what is most alien to our sense of ourselves is simultaneously what is at the core of our self um it is simultaneously what is uh most uh uh precious what is most essential um to how we think our conscious self-reflective experience our let's say egoic experience or even our symbolic sense of where where we stand um in in in our organization so how can we then conceptualize um this idea this idea of a constit of a constitutive inconsistency within some sort of communicative or informatic system um uh within this model within this model that um SS has put forward regarding affective Consciousness free energy minimization uh and and the like first um this requires a crucial philosophical shift uh uh and and and this is implicit for some uh uh not for others but it it it Bears help by stating it explicitly um uh and what this is what I'm calling following Adrian Johnston sort of what's called capital N nature and this idea of capital N nature is an idea that the laws whatever those laws might be in nature are fully determinate in that they fully determine the behavior of material particles they fully determine what happens by stuff um generally and simply speaking and two they are seamless uh in other words they're non-conflicting um they sort of govern in a um sort of idealized fashion all of the operations of whatever there might be and in a wonderful exchange between friston and I forget which um uh Journal it was a philosophical critique of the pre energy principle saying that okay you're just you're just saying everything's marov blanket so then you get to use the feny principle to explain everything um and I think the response was wonderful it was like yes it is all marov blankets all the way down um uh uh and and one way of potentially reading that um and in this um pre-print um uh uh that you can find um from from Carl friston is that uh this uh sort of uh uh the mathematics that follow from delineating things self organ or self-organizing systems as delineated by the possession of a marov blanket means that you can actually apply this from the very tiny things of quantum mechanics all the way up through to the macro scale of classical mechanics and the argument here and this would be um an anti-reductionist um nightmare is that um all of the behavior of these systems from very small to very large can be subsumed within um a seamless chain of free energy uh uh minimization of obeying something like friston's law as it gets applied um in in these different States and I am not by any means an expert on the mathematics here so I I welcome any um Corrections on that point but um I think the fear for some would be that okay you're saying everything can be reduced to free energy minimization and then this leads some people to then say okay well no there exists something that defies um a reduction in this way and we can maybe talk about it in a somewhat mystical way as um you know uh being or something purely negative uh uh or transcendental like that now the alternative that I want to put forward is that this is not the only way to think about nature and this is the perspective from Adrian Johnson what he calls transcendental materialism and weak nature so to speak and weak nature uh refers to the idea that um and it's it's a materialist philosophical position there are only natural material phenomena there is no special transcendental subjectivity that only exists because we speak um there is no sort of special uh uh uh quasi dualist but you might you don't want to say the word dualist sort of a thing that defies capture by uh any sort of natural uh science or any sort of material Theory there are only these uh phenomena however the laws that govern nature are not seamless uh they are not uh fully able to assert themselves and especially they do not uh uh sit in a perfect harmony with each other what I'm what I'm calling weak laws in in contrast to strong laws that fully determine and and uh line up a perfect mathematical equation weak laws conflict with each other and because of that conflict fail to fully assert themselves and therefore and this is this is how the sort of transcendental Dimension comes in here the more than natural quote unquote phenomena that are traditionally described as something transcendental like human subjectivity they emerge not in a determin IC fashion out of the lower levels but they emerge out of the conflicts and antagonisms of those lower levels the points where weak laws come into Rift with each other where they bump up those points are points of of non-determinate emergence because they're not emerging from points where determination is working the way it would it comes sort of uh uh the logic of an accident uh the logic of emergence from something that's not working um an emergence from some sort of uh antagonism uh and a way to kind of put this formulaically complexity breeds negativity um this negativity of what's sort of not positivistic determined um as things get more complex there are more opportunities and more risks of things short circuiting and more room for things to go wrong and by go wrong this means something new happens and this sort of emergence by surprise and you can think about this I this is wonderfully wonderful book by Daniel Milo um that uh you sometimes we think of evolution as you know this strong uh force of you adaptation it's well the The evolutionary bar to survive and reproduce is a relatively low bar um you can have lots of things inherited think of the number of genetic diseases that get passed down because yeah and they're not ideal those are not adaptive those are not um the best for for for minimizing um uncertainty and preserving the state of the system nevertheless you just need to live long enough to survive and reproduce according to evolutionary law it's not a strong law in the sense of producing perfectly adaptive brain uh or a brain without um conflicts that as long as they don't um uh severely undermine this um reproductive and survival capacity they they can slip by um and on the psych analytic or forian side this is the argument and this is not only um uh uh my argument this is or from uh folks who work in in neuros Psych analysis this is arguments from within purely fian psych analysis as well when Freud uh tries to argue for a beyond the Pleasure Principle the sense of a death Drive um drive toward inertia um a drive towards sort of repetition as an innate feature in a way he sort of props up the Pleasure Principle as then working to do its thing and then okay no when the Pleasure Principle doesn't excuse me work it's because there's some Death Drive interfering and this is the contrast argument that no there is no beyond the Pleasure Principle this I'm taking from Jonathan Lear uh there is just the Pleasure Principle but the Pleasure Principle is itself prone to false repetitions of Prior satisfactions leading it astray and so on simply put the Pleasure Principle does its thing but it it doesn't do it perfectly um it's not a strong law um the law of the Pleasure Principle is quote unquote weak law so I argue that we can find this kind of uh logic at this point within the model that uh SS has put forward so within here there is the presence of multiple categories of homeostatic demand that have to be contextually prioritized in conditions especially of uncertainty what this is saying is that within the brain within the level of innate hyper priors within the predictive model there are conflict uh there are uh there is antagonism uh I gave just one example the conflict between attachment and uh uh rage where you want to remove frustrations to your goals these conflicts can easily be multiplied among even just uh uh various emotional socio emotional systems let alone when we get into the problem of having to think about the fact that other self-organizing systems themselves have in a hyper and they kind of depend on them to help me with my stuff so I need to take that into account there's all of opportunities for conflict um and not only that uh within this model these uh different systems cannot be uh uh uh equated into one common denominator there is no sort of um uh uh equation to say okay S10 of seeking equals 34s of Rage equals 510 of fear so you can add that up to get um I don't know what the math would be but whatever uh 20th percent of total overall free energy um that equation can happen because these are innate categorically distinct um uh hyper priors um uh what you need to do to deal with attachment needs differs from what you need to do to deal with Hunger differs from what you need to do to deal with um needs to explore and engage with novelty and uncertainty so whichever and you have to prioritize one because if not then you're just sort of helpless before this chaos um but in prioritizing one you're necess neily um leaving something else uh uh uncertain leaving some residual surprise or or free energy elsewhere um because these cannot be fully uh subsumed under under one category and so it is because of this innate conflict this innate antagonism that there is affective Consciousness um affective Consciousness as the need to feel your way through uncertainty to feel your way through the predictions you're employing in okay I don't know which to prioritize here I'm going to prioritize this but I'm not quite sure what to do and then I have to kind of feel what feels a little better what feels a little worse this depends on contradiction this depends on this innate conflict between categorically distinct domains of free energy all within a single complex self-organizing system um now um on the computational side even though yes uh it is the case that the brain does compute an overall measure of quote unquote total free energy or domain General free energy um uh this does not eliminate the difference between these domain specific categories of free energy uh just because the number is calculated to allow computations and allow action perception Cycles to occur uh to not sort of just leave everything at a halt so to speak this this should not be read as doing away with this uh difference at the level of the inate informatic ontology uh uh that calculation uh facilitates adaptive functioning facilitates moving through the world but it doesn't undo the fact that no there is this conflict it's not a conflict that is remedied um uh it's one that is a constant sort of tension uh uh that persists and so just going back to this sort of diagram here um what we see not simply that there's just some uh simply existing thing there uh it's not just some uh uh system which uh does its thing of uh minimizing free energy well no there's actually already there some sort of antagonism or conflict uh uh that problematizes a straightforward application of friston's law uh it it it it problematizes um in the sense that well we're in situations all the time where it's not clear what to do let alone which systems prioritize uh to perfectly minimize free energy and pontic clinical phenomena testify to this I think in a very clear fashion so so um I just want to close on um uh the main sort of questions I have um and sort of ideas I have that I'm hoping we can discuss in addition to to anything else that comes up but I really want to I'm curious and I really think you know what are really like the consequences for a self-organizing system which contains categorically distinct and contradictory domains of free energy uh what does it mean to to think about the free energy principle where there is this sort of necessary Rift uh within a conscious system of uh different uh hyper priors uh that don't seamlessly fit together uh they they don't form a harmonious ho um and and this this leaves a certain uh uh necessity for conflict um what does it mean for the for a system to uh obey friston's law when the elimination of free energy is um impossible if uh these innate categories of free conflict with each other uh in in this fashion and then that's that's the the key point it's not that um uh minimizing energy is just because the environment is complicated although it is and this introduces all sorts of complications but it's also um this this innate architecture of affect of Consciousness where you have these different domains of free energy um where sort of almost by definition um moving down One path uh means that there's some residual or Surplus for energy somewhere else hence we continue to be conscious uh hence we uh uh never eliminate uh our background uh uh background level a minimal level of uncertainty that's palpating through the hierarchy um in other words uh what does it mean uh uh when the system's efforts to minimize free energy inevitably produce uh free energy and this would be again the the sort of leanian twist that I'm coming from without stating all of the leanian theory here that um uh language itself produces its own excesses it produces its own uncertainties um so I'll leave it at that and uh thank you very much awesome thank you John shall I stop sharing uh sure okay whoever is moved to let us begin with some initial comments from the panel um thank you John very much I'll I'll uh dare to start uh with some very small remarks uh the the first and probably the main remark is that I fear that um we are not going to find anything to disagree about um so how are we going to have an interesting discussion if we all see things the same way um so uh hopefully I will be able to find something to disagree with you about and so um in that spirit let me let me make one or two further remarks um you invoke um my uh argument that the different needs of a complex organism um are have to be treated categorically Ally uh they have to be treated as categorical variables uh not as as it happens because they require you to do different things and those different things conflict with each other uh but uh because they each of them have to be met in their own right that's the crucial Point uh that it it doesn't help to reduce the total quantity of free energy if it if you leave out one of the categories in other words you always have to breathe as well as drink as well as sleep Etc um so it's in this sense that they they they they they it's it's it's obligatory that they be treated as categorical variables in other words eight out of 10 of sleepiness and eight out of 10 of thirst are not the same thing they are qualitatively different and incidentally that for me is the ground zero of qualia it's why we have to have different qualities in the mind um so you invoke that argument of mine and I'm very uh glad to be to be cited uh in in that way but I just want to make the point that you don't need to invoke that argument of mine which is as it were built upon or even imposed upon Call's um a bigger deeper uh uh free energy principle I think that it's inherent in Carl's own idea ideas uh for example just to mention one and really I could I could think of a few but the the inherent antagonism between uh uh complexity and accuracy uh you could have you could have cited that example which is really a pretty basic principle a pretty basic part of the um standard formalism that's used uh by people working within Call's frame work simply put um in in order to maximize accuracy which is a good thing uh you have to increase complexity which is a Bad Thing uh in order to maximize uh Simplicity which is a good thing you have to Forfeit accuracy which is a Bad Thing uh and so there's an inherent antagonism there um and uh as I say I can I could think of several others but that's enough uh to to um make the point uh in other words I want to make the point that it's uh it's it's although I'm glad to be cited in this context I think that your argument applies to uh to the the far more fundamental formulation uh that that Carl uh has given us then um one last point and remember I'm just trying to get the ball rolling and I'm trying to find is there something we can disagree about um I I I'm no philosopher by the way I'm such a a badly educated philosopher that I didn't even understand your joke at the beginning about the cannibals uh but um the um I'm no philosopher but the the the the one thing that Jarred for me uh if I understood you correctly is that you're recommending that a dual aspect monist uh metaphysics be replaced by a transcendental materialist metaphysics uh I can only assume that's what you're saying because I don't see how you can reconcile uh a materialist metaphysics uh with a dual aspect monist metaphysics and I because you know the materialist is one side of the Dual aspects uh so that's the one thing that Jarred for me um I think that you know I I cling to dual aspect monism because uh we want to find a place in um Natural Science for subjectivity the fact that it exists uh here we are experiencing it right now it's part of Nature and we have to find some way uh of of of reconciling it with our with our materialist conception of the universe and uh for me the answer is to uh to recognize that the material uh perspect perspective is also a perspective in other words there too we're dealing with phenomena as observed by sentient Minds The subjective and the objective are both P perceptual uh Vantage points upon something which lies Beyond both appearances and that thing which lies Beyond both appearances must lie beyond the the the the phenomenal properties of matter and that's why Carl's hold way of thinking appeals to me so profoundly you know the the idea I mean it It ultimately goes back Carl's way of thinking to Galileo telling us that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics um as I'm speaking I realize um that there's one other thing I might be able to disagree with you about but let me stop there because I I I I I fear I'm not going to be able to find something stronger to disagree with you about than that thank you sh shall I say something or um so thank you uh thank you Mark um and um I perhaps um uh after hearing from some some other folks I'll I'll say more uh less the point of disagreement but more an open question that I have um but at least regarding uh dual aspect monism and transcendental materialism um my my my sense is wanting to supplement it not replace and I think this is where there would be a a need to re theorize something in transcendental materialism as it has been theorized where um I don't want to say transcendental informatic ISM or I'm not a philosopher um so I'm I'm not I'm not sure how to say it but basically the to apply this this way of thinking of uh uh uh weak laws uh emergence from conflict emergence from uh things not working uh out uh uh that sort of thing to uh to how we think about that whatever that thing is in nature Beyond um both phenomena so but the the way that I interpret the materialism in um transcendental materialism is perhaps closer to um the the the idea of information and this this is why um like when Lan says the the Lan will say the materiality of language um and this is a materiality not necessarily in like the the stuff that they can hold in everything it's it's a it's an open question I think but Lan uh and he changes how he thinks about that through over time but um in this sense of of the idea of communication the idea of uh uh information and negative entropy oh maybe I can uh Al ask some questions um thank you John first of all uh it's such a pleasure to hear you kind of tie together all of these different threads um it's uh it's really impressive um yeah the first point I'd like to make is maybe um um in relation to Adrien Johnston's uh um transcendental materialism like there is in his work also kind of some doubt about how to formulate kind of his own project I guess um he has this essay from 2020 uh called um metat transcendentalism and error first ontology um where he says that he's come to consider the descriptive label of critical dialectical naturalism synonymous to if not prefer able to transcendental materialism and then he says specifically because for him it condenses in a single phrase kind of idealist methodology and then realist materialist naturalist onology um so I'd be yeah I'd be curious if there if if if you have reasons to stick or prefer transcendental materialism or uh whe whether you would would consider these um um in inter interchangeable um and and my other question um um maybe also has an attempt to I guess stir the pot in a way in terms of finding a point of disagreement between between you and Mark um not not for the sake of it but because that's a question I'm quite interested in um um you didn't mention it today but uh since it's in the title of enjoying uncertainty uh I'm curious about this point of leanian Drive being on the side of increases in tension um and in that sense operating outside or beyond the the logic of homeostasis um as as I understand it in your work um and I guess yeah I would I would like to maybe push back a little bit on that point um to the degree that I wonder whether that kind of resistance towards the concept of homeostasis doesn't have a lot if got most to do with kind of lon's concept of homeostasis uh because correct me if I'm wrong but I think in seminar 2 he defines it or he says something like you know homeostasis can mean one of two things the first is uh an equilibrium of a system and the second thing is death um and then 10 years later like in the four fundamental concepts of of Psych analysis kind of he repeats these same points so I don't think it was it was a quirk of that time um so I I do wonder if like with the kind of more contemporary concept of of homeostasis including the seeking system and all of the conflicts that you know arise in that and that you uh um I think so brilliantly kind of emphasize and and uh uh put in the Forefront um yeah is it is is that that rejection or that resistance towards the concept of homeostasis really necessary yeah thanks ever and I and this would be my uh yeah point for uh kind of question potential disagreement um uh that if if we then take the next step it's that at this point uh that that I'm carving of a of Consciousness as AR arising not from uh free energy minimization but from the contradiction and conflict of these different not only categories ofers but even um uh complexity accuracy trade-offs um within the model that um something else uh comes up there and and uh one way that one way to think about it is that okay yeah there's something here um having to do with not just trying to minimize uncertainty uh uh and and at least and this is coming into some more of the the the the clinical Theory um but uh not not only about minimizing uncertainty but finding a way or the fact that um errors and uncertainty is enjoyed in a certain way and this is Lan's idea of j s um uh that it's enjoyed not necessarily consciously but uh enjoyed in uh in its own uh unconscious or it's it's an enjoyment that can't be experienced as such uh the quote unquote strange satisfaction of the symptom that that fre uh remarks um but it's this I I I wonder and this is what I was talking about with um okay what does it mean for a system to try to minimize free energy when it's impossible to to reach that until death um as is pointed out um that yeah there's something about um I think a proactive engagement and enjoyment of uncertainty that I'm not quite sure um is only seeking and this is where I'm I I'm really curious uh because seeking has its own certain qualitative feel to it uh um the you know enjoyment of uh uh no novelty epistemic foraging uh you know the the dog running around in the field and you know having all fun and whatnot um uh but that that that there there's also these points where there's um uh some kind of repetition or some kind of either maintenance or increase of free energy that has a certain uh enjoyment to it um symptomatic enjoyment perhaps and that at least from a leanian perspective ultimately the goal is not to minimize that free energy uh in the sense of remove the tension uh the goal is not to in to get rid of the symptom or to replace the symptom with a better thing or some better more um uh adaptive plan uh it's to sort of confront this logic of okay no there is something at the core of one's being that exists because things don't work what's a way what's something that can be done with that uh and this is idea of of of enjoying one's symptom of of uh uh uh and and this is where where I I have questions like I don't know what how to think about it necessarily computationally but what would it be to modulate uh something uh uh deep predictions in that sense to modulate them in such a way that uh they repeat they continue to produce free energy they continue to to lead to increases UN in uncertainty but in a way that uh allows the person to kind of uh find find a a vivifying dimension uh uh to that to to their symptom to find a vivifying dimension uh uh to how they go about uh managing and uh enjoying uh uncertainty rather than uh uh this at least the illusion it makes to the system just trying to you know totally get rid of it uh in a way um and and I think that I think that's where the lanan phys differs I think from from how you've conceptualized it Mark where there's it's not the idea with um illegitimate predictions maturely automatized predictions not only the idea of laying down better ones that can hopefully work and be more adaptive but also to to do something different with the prematurely automatized predictions that um sustain ones that are sort of your unique way of dealing with the conflicts of these different categories of free energy um uh and and in that way to do something different with it uh but yeah I'm I'm not sure how that shows up or or how that would uh play out uh [Music] computationally I'm I'm going to resist saying anything more until we've heard from call yeah I'm I'm the eldest so I have to go last really but uh I can't resist slipping in here um yeah that was a wonderful presentation but actually your last response was was revealing so I learned quite a lot uh in terms of this um the you know what Lan brings to the table that you know may have to well I imagine the ambition here is to sort of naturalize that in terms of current thinking about um about the way we understand um senting Behavior and the like um so um before I comment upon the the two sets of questions which I thought were fascinating what I've done and this is really for Daniel I've gone through whilst listening to the talk identifying papers that um you may not have referenced from other literatures that I think lend weight to your a number of specific points you made during uh the presentation so if there's time at some point close to the end um I've got about four or five um actually six papers that you might enjoy reading completely outside I think your your sort of sphere of reading um that do pick up on some of the sort of fundaments that you you were positing as um key key parts of the argument so I'm saying that uh just to forewarn you that if I can at some point share my screen and just flick through because I know this has been recorded then you can go back and have a look um to see if anything is interesting ranging from girdle's theorem to strange Loops you know there's a lot of resonance with um um other formulations outside the other sphere in which we're talking um but just come back to those sort of key issues um perhaps in reverse order um so this notion of um enjoying the uncertainty um or enjoying um um paradoxical increases in free energy um is there a mathematical formalism that would um resolve that Paradox um or sort of paradoxical um account um that would also accommodate um Notions of homeostasis as read by Lan um at the same time could be read in terms of self-organization from a physics perspective or you so me from a panal systems perspective um I two things occur to me first of all your repeated account of um the um going Beyond just seeking um as one ex manifestation of of this enjoying your your uncertainty um I I thought was very interesting because I had assumed when you started answering that this would be exactly the epistemically expected information game that underwrites behavior so when people talk about minimizing free energy that's fine um when one's talking about sense making but when one is talking about how we engage with the world and the decisions and the choices that we make or the things that we select to do um then one has to think about the expected free energy expected following that choice or decision or act or um uh intention um and um from that perspective you know the complexity and the accuracy that Mark was referring to now become um risk and ambiguity or when we Ed expected Information Gain versus um expected cost um and um the expected information G I think does appear to have a lot of EX simple expound um um capacity in talking about the Allure of uncertainty and you said that beautifully you talked about novelty seeking you talked about um epistemic foraging um and you know I was surprised to hear that that for you wasn't a sufficient explanation and perhaps it's because you you were associating um the epistemic foraging with seeking of a particular uh of a particular sort but a lot of what you said um um seems to me to be exactly the notion that we enjoy um um pushing the boundaries in the fond hope or knowledge that we will be able to resolve that uncertainty and become wiser and more um um more confident in our engagement you with the world and it it reminds me very much of an argument um put forward for why we actively listen to music um particularly jazz music uh which you know has that exactly the right kind of predictable unpredictability to keep us engaged and I'm you know unusually the argument here is that um I don't know what's going to happen but I do know I will know if I keep on doing this very much like listening to a joke I don't know what the punch line is going to be but I do know if I commit to this this uh your direction of travel then I will be amused and some you know and that Amusement that pleasure will be um if you like scored by the resolution of uncertainty in a volatile and unknown space environment you know in the space of jokes in that instance um so I I you know I would and I won't say anything more about that but it'd be interesting if you could discuss what is the this sort of um um essence of enjoying uncertainty that is um not explained by knowing I'm going to reduce my uncertainty but first I have to actually put myself in a situation where I'm seeking out those uh you know that potential for resolution of uncertainty about me about mom about the jazz music mathematically um I'm wondering whether one way of sort of bringing Lan into the 21st century would be to go back to something I found quite fascinating which was the two ways of reading homeostasis um as I understand it from what ever was saying um so um death is certainly one kind of homeostasis um but clearly it's not the kind of homeostasis that we associate with um biotic self-organization and the mathematical distinction between the two is between equilibrium steady States and non-e equilibrium steady States now all of physics um and certainly kind of school boy physics you you would have been um exposed to uh when talking about thermodynamic freey minimization pertains to a point equilibrium so in the language of um dyal systems the we're talking about a point attractor so at the point you converge to your point ATT tractor everything ceases you're dead you're cold you're a free energy minimum um and you and that's a perfectly apt description of closed systems you know that is what will happen if you isolated from a world but when you're open to the world across um your Markoff blanket for example um then we're talking about a different kind of equil a non-equilibrium uh steady state and this has a characteristic itinerancy I mean mathematically can um it's um and I I can't resist slipping this in because it it also uh appeals again to sort of hel Hing ideas but in this instance um it has to be the case in any system that is far from equilibrium or open to an environment that has attained some kind of steady state I persists and exists it has to have a solenoidal aspect to it by the helm host decomposition that is a mathematical truism now there are many ways of reading that solenoidal aspect it could be a bi Rhythm it could be an oscillation it could be um replication Dynamics at an evolutionary scale it could be walking it could be talking could be my heart y everything that returns to some point in a weak sense so it's not exactly but returns to the neighborhood and I just um I I just pick up on that because of for many reasons but specifically because of your the repetition aspect of of this kind of um um aspect uh sorry of that um um the phenomenology that you were talking about where where there is exactly this description of the particular itinerancy that characterizes um free energy Minima that are a result of attaining a non-equilibrium steady state so you have this iy there can't be any other way of keeping within an attracting set unless you keep returning to the point that nearby point that you once that you were once in so I'm just wondering if you want to go beyond seeking and Beyond um epistemic foraging um then perhaps what you're saying is well yes but this is in the context that I am on this attracting set that has this quintessentially biotic kind of um recurrence or or or or repeatability that gives it an ey tendency at at many many different time scales that makes me the kind of thing that I am um and ex you know in this environment in which you know to which to which I'm I'm open so I just put that out there as a possible mathematical metaphor for for talking about sort of what Lan is referring to if you want a physiological metaphor I think it's important to actually um distinguish now between homeostasis homeor resis and allostasis and aleris if there is such a thing so the distinctions are the homeostasis is fast reflexive whereas the anastasis actually has some future pointing aspect do it so you can plan to be homeostatic but that in itself is not homeostasis it you know it brings a certain uh depth and itiner and one could argue in virtue of the depth it takes you much closer to the kind of structures and you know the um Reliance upon um Precision modulation that that you were talking to but there's another um axis here which is the difference between stasis and Reeses so homeor resis is like homeostasis but for paths and of course as soon as we're talking about um systems that have itinerant orbits where you do have to keep revisiting characteristic states of being at many many different time scales then the kind of homeostasis what you're talking about is now homeor resis is actually keeping close to that path um and I'm just wondering if Lan Lan's distinction between the two kinds of homeostasis was really a distinction between mathematical homeostasis which is a point of tractor and death and homeor resis which is keeping to a path uh or a set of paths that define an orbit usually chaotic and it's usually stastical far too much I'm come I'm going to go back to the the the um Mark's initial observation just to celebrate that um so you um in my world there's a distinction between between categorical and continuous variables um and I think Mark was picking up on that and I think he was absolutely right to do that I do think that there's a really important role for categorical generative models um in relation to the description about sort of symbols and language and sort of carving nature into discrete ways of being I think that's absolutely essential and I'm sure you're right that some unconscious um processing um You probably takes place under discreet language like um um generative models and possibly also um conscious processing um but the I think that's an orthogonal argument from um the notion the really important notion I think you were you were trying to get across which is that there are multiple constraints um that um um provide another kind of conflict because I've got sort of multiple Dimensions that I have to I have to um comply with it's not just onedimensional pleasure there is pleasure in multiple multiple dimensions and sometimes some of the the Excursion along one dimension may be more um um unpleasurable than the Excursion along another dimension and that both of those if you like the degree of Excursion will be very context sensitive and hence I now have to prioritize do I want to sort of be homeotic in this Dimension or that Di menion and I think Mark was trying to say that it's the multi-dimensional aspect that there are there are more than one discrete Dimensions to um the way that we have to um well mathematically in terms of the extended free energy evaluate the cost of this particular plan um and that provides a profound departure from things like reinforcement learning where there's only one um Dimension so I've now taken to talking about not expected value or utility but expected cost the negative of that so I can now say that this minimization of expected cost part of the expected free energy um is effectively a multiple constraint satisfaction problem and it's usually if you read the sort of you know the um the math literature active inflence that's usually incured by c um uh and one of the reasons for C is it stands in for constraints but it's multiple constraints in every dimension that you that there exists an outcome and of course if you now condition C on some inferred state of being or some context um then you have exactly what you were saying which is this problem of actually prioritizing this constraint over over over that constraint the reason I like the word constraint is that um you can now speak to physicists who believe that the free energy principle is dual to James's constrained maximum entropy or caliber principle the the entropy is for points so that be the homeostasis the caliber is for the path so that would be the homeis so now you've got a way of talking to physicists because what you're saying is it's all in the constraints and these constraints are multiple there are as many dimensional as as the dimensionality of of the phase space so again I'm I'm just trying trying to sort of um join um enable you to sort of generalize you know these Rel important points in a way that might actually have a a relatively simple mathematical um basis in fact it's almost unavoidable um and certainly that that notion of multiple constraints and inducing a kind of conflict although you are effectively in a multiple constraint satisfaction resolving that con that Conflict by prioritizing exactly as you say those constraints what could also be called prior preferences but um if you think of a constraint or a cost as a negative prior preference or preference then then I think that all makes sense I I got so much more to say but I'm going to stop talking now no thank you call that that's that's really uh fascinating and this helps me I think um maybe formulate what I'm trying to think through from the from the Lan end of things so I I think that the the the the uh I think I think why there would be um some suspicion of the expected free energy calculation as this sort of um uh the enjoying of engaging with novel uncertainty and and that sort of thing is because well um generally when it sounds too adaptive um and you know volans don't like that but um uh the idea that the the the enjoyment um doesn't derive from the fact that okay I'm going to engage with this uncertainty because and then I know that I will get that pleasure in the end and then it will meet that need that it's it's um almost enjoyment for its own sake um or the increase of uncertainty almost for its own sake but what I think would bring it together is that um it would be uh and my use of the terms might not be correct uh sort of technically but the sort of uh ways of thinking through the expected uh uncertainty would be for uh an an anticipated feature that never actually material uh an anticipated um outcome and this I think would maybe approximate what what Lan calls the fantasy uh uh and specifically the unconscious fantasy which is not um it's not uh imagistic it's sort of uh uh it's something that is never uh uh formulated explicitly can only be constructed um in the course of a treatment but it's sort of um the virtual terminal point upon which um of of these scenes of increased repetitions that don't work out um it would be this sort of this increase of uncertainty that leads to bad outcomes um that doesn't ultimately lead to the decrease of free energy um and yet it repeats regardless uh and the the the to rationalize that um symptomatic let's say repetition is by reference to some kind of fantasy formulation of oh you know this is what the this is the anticipated outcome that the the person had that uh gives a little sense to why this repetition was happening why this repeated um uh increase of free energy which is this weird kind of enjoyment um without the more as as as we typically think about in terms of adaptive uh learning um by evaluating potential costs uh uh for uh different policies and things um and I think that that would be potentially um one one way of of bringing those together and it's it's uh uh the homeo reesus idea is is very uh interesting where there's this I I can find it somewhere but there's this diagram Lan has for the drive um and it's he draws it as um as as a loop as an arrow Loop encircling um uh negativity encircling something that you never quite hit um and and that's why the drive has this repetitive logic and it repeats uh en circles something that it is aiming at but never quite lands on in part because uh it has a purely uh fantasmatic status that there isn't something that um could finally be hit um and hence and hence the repetition continues um so perhaps that that would be I think um I I think one way to link the uh to link seeking and EXP free energy um through expected free energy for future that doesn't exist uh nevertheless exists in the in the unconscious for the subject [Music] um I'll read a question or two from the live chat okay Andrew writes where do you place the reality principle in your mapping in seminar 7 Leon seems to view it as being in service of the Pleasure Principle so is it a lesser priority concept to incorporate here yeah that that's really great and I think um I I don't make a huge distinction because of that that it's still ultimately in the service of the Pleasure Principle but um one of the points that is also made is that the reality principle not only as a sort of self-correcting uh mechanism in the sense of uh learning and updating uh prior predictions based on uh uh new experiences in that sense but also Lan talks about reality principle as um the index to the the the the maintenance of a minimal level of tension in the psyche uh uh the maintenance of um uh from the the the uh the exigencies of Life uh that uh cause there to be a certain minimal constant level of tension and that that um that that maintenance being linked to what we've been discussing as this okay what what does one then do with this uh uh sort of necessity of repeating uh uncertainty that has this uh at least subjectively or or phenomenologically this paradoxical uh component to it awesome another question from the chat for you John or anyone Kendra wrote does affect Consciousness itself emerge as a mistake from the complexity of self-organizing system if I can speak metaphorically yes as a mistake but but it's a good mistake and and it's in the sense of um the um slav has this uh thing of you know it's something that happens by accident but then it was something that turned out to be to be good you know you trying to you're you're trying to do something something goes wrong then oh wow but this is new and unexpected but it it but it still works in its own way um like the making of um games uh novel invention or making of uh in history you know different Cuisines or different foods or cheeses or wines that emerge because something wrong a mistake happened in the fermentation process but oh look now we have this and and now now this is something that's all wonderful uh and I I I I think that um that's one nice way to think about clinical work of uh and from from a lanan perspective it's that okay can can something differently be done or can something new come from uh this this mistake uh quote unquote mistake of uh uh how one is uh maintaining a drive circuit or maintaining a certain uh repetition of of uncertainty uh that still sustains it but in a different way awesome Bucky Fuller talked about mistake mystique and it's sort of a living systems perspective with the error first ontology and the vivifying perspective on the differential rather than like dust in a motor which will just inevitably make it more and more off kilter how are you going to continue with the work or where is the book and everything at uh well the the book is published very um uh thankfully and um I I I I can't say exactly where where the next step is but I'm uh uh going trying to apply this a little more empirically uh is is is my my personal hope um Mark I wanted to invite you you said that you had a potential point of disagreement and uh uh I just wanted to make sure you you could you could air that um I think that given the time constraints I won't go down that particular path um but I I'll rather pick up on I'm also aware that we must leave time for Carl to share his screen because I too would love to see those references that he has in mind but um so so I'll just make one final remark which has to do with the the main thread of disagreement that I'm pleased to see we did manage to find uh about um uh the the equating of Jance with uh with seeking um and you said uh almost uh in passing uh and I think almost embarrassedly you said well leanians don't like uh to uh to to explain in this sort of way because it sounds too adaptive um so I I want to comment on that and I saw a little frown on Carl's face when you said that and I shared the frown without expressing it so this this is what what I think we we have to take seriously uh feelings um you know once they evolved uh they become part of Nature and they do something they actually have causal powers and I think that you know that we all too easily forget that um now uh the the feeling of lust clearly uh the Adaptive uh in other words why it was selected in why why why it's such a feeling evolved is because it encourages us to perform sexual acts uh which ultimately result in the uh in reproduction and therefore in the survival of our species uh but that's not what motivates each sentient subject uh to to um to have sex uh what motivates us is the feeling and uh the the feeling um very frequently we want the pleasure without reproducing we we're hoping not to reproduce so the the feeling has motivational power has causal power all of its own quite independently of the uh of the adaptive mechanisms whereby it evolved now all I wanted to say is the same applies to seeking uh seeking evolved uh for the very good reasons that we've been discussing uh that it is positively a good thing uh in terms of U long-term free energy minimization uh to to positively engage with uncertainty and to increase your your your your free energy in the process but the feeling uh is has the same relationship uh to that the feeling in other words the the the in my view the the the feeling that lon's talking about the the enjoyment of the increased um attention uh the the feeling exists in its own right and and has its own status and so you don't know I am engaging with uncertainty now because in the long run this is going to reduce my free energy not at all you're just engaging with uncertainty because it's nice and so it feels good uh you know not why uh and and and I I I still find that the most satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon that laon is is is uh trying to explain there thanks I've enjoyed this conversation very much thank you thank you Mark ever any last words and then Carl you can share your screen um yes thank you I also I thought this discussion was great um yeah I'm also really interested in um this point of how expected free energy May accommodate the phenomena that you describe in leanian terms especially maybe when we're dealing with expected free energy not just in the sense of what will happen based on my current beliefs but maybe especially once you get to the more complicated schemes for example in the case of Professor friston's sophisticated inference where it's not just a matter of what will happen based on what I believe but also what will I believe based on what happens please correct me if I if I I hope I don't butcher it now but like where the where the whole the whole Cascade gets gets um more and more complicated I kind of disconnected from the present as it as it proceeds um yeah yeah that's that that's what I want to add no you didn't but butcher it at all it's very sophisticated to mention sophisticated inference in um I I'm wondering with the point that um Mark was alluding to there is that all the ingredients that go into the computation of an expected free energy um and it's just interesting to know that this some of these ingredients uh emerge as things called intrinsic motivation in neur robotics so when you're actually um if if you're looking for attachment Theory with robots there are people who do this a lot um and they understand that expected the seeking part of a certain kind very Elemental kind in terms of intrinsic motivation which I Al find qu quite quite nice um sorry but what I was going to say was um the the the evaluation of all of these moving parts that contribute to the the different and potentially conflicting aspects of the composition of the expected energy rest upon the Precision which brings us back to the Precision now that doesn't come from Magic it has to come from your generative model so there has to be a state of mind that can prescribe and Implement and switch on the right precisions in this context and exactly the way I think both John and Mark were talking about and I think it's at that level or possibly even a meta level above that the the feeling gets into the game um so it's not the is not the intrinsic motivation in and of itself that is felt it is all the enabling of the prioritization via the precisions that will Nuance what is intrinsically motivating what you know what um um you know what compels me to seek what compels me to you know and so so forth and I recognize that this particular profile of precision is mine and and it is um associated with this deployment of the Precision and the activation of the mechanisms that would be required to to modulate that so I think the feeling um could be completely divorced from the actual um uh expected free energy in the sense that you know um even if my expected free energy was was um non-adaptive in the sense I have absolutely no idea what to do next I'm bored there's no more epistemic value in this environment I have no preferences um you know I just don't know what's going you know what what to do what to do next I may actually see that as a displeasure thing or a pleasurable thing um simply because in order to set that um set that profile I've had to induce a particular Precision which is apt for this for this particular particular context so I think that you know that metacognitive or deep aspect where um you need to have that particular depth to your to your self morals in order to specify what Precision is up for this moment may be something that that is you know allows you a little bit of latitude in terms of feeling good about what is completely maladaptive and vice versa um I don't know I suspect that's that in part was was a point that uh that that Mark Mark was making do you want to share your slides or papers Carl and then that will be I do but I I I I I can say it's three minutes P um we I could just do this for for for JN and Mark um if um if we're we're we're over time do just do it all right let's just go and uh um yeah I should apologize feel a bit naive now I clearly did not understand the repetition compulsion and I have to think more about that so yeah share screen it's going to share screen in the live chat Carl we're trying to understand whether reading your papers is it only about the value of the information and and the and the uh the expected cost of course um I in fact yes so here we were so this is documentary proof that I have now taken to referring to Prior preferences as expected cost so that you can use this phrase multiple constraint satisfaction where the cost um um if like scores the constraints and just to reemphasize it's a multi-dimensional has many dimensions as there are outcomes that one could possibly sense measure infer or or observe um so this is from a re the most recent description of the expected free energy um um in biological psychology from the supervised structure learning but that's uh yeah where there we are what I thought was um just coming back to this the the original joke um um about um the cannibal um the cannibal eat um um having eaten the last cannibal on um on the island I um I I thought that the story was going to be unpacked in terms of the um the inability of ourselves to represent ourselves um and um I'm just compelled by Chris Field's work in this space where he stays close to the physics in his own words to to to demonstrate that um self-representation at some level of recursion and some level of depth is a mathematical impossibility so I just wondered whether whether that was um um what was being intimated uh you know by that joke it it transpired that it probably wasn't so important in the central argument but um I just put this um paper up um by Chris Fields um and Mike Levin uh just as a recent treatment of this from the point of view of the physics um there is also a treatment of this from the point of view of Consciousness um um where in a slightly more narrative form this you know this impossibility of seeing oneself or representing oneself uh at a certain depth or recursion or sophistication in an economic sense um inherits from the notion of an irreducible markof blanket that can't be um subdivided on the inside so the only way that this particular irreducible Markoff blanket or system in the brain which could be uh distributed and would certainly include um the um the sources of neuromodulation in the spirit of uh Mark's thesis which is explicitly mentioned in this paper um the only way that it can see itself is by acting upon the rest of the brain for example and that action can only be through deploying Precision um so I thought there was a nice point of contact between the purely mathematical treatment of self-representation and how it might be unpacked this is a paper which is um gone through many many versions but um um uh talks about the inner screen model of Consciousness which is on archives first Au author ramstead um but Chris was a key uh key um author of um on that um the um now that was just reiterating oh yes um I talking about sort of um we claws um um could be read in many different ways um and um you know what one aspect of this um could be that we're not talking about deterministic systems we're talking about stochastic systems that can only be described probabilistically another aspect of this is um the departure from deterministic systems as we move into real um or um certainly from the physics protected biotic systems that have um a a a chaotic aspect that is often called or um uh has a mathematical characteristic of strangeness which is um um exploited in this treatment of strange particles um with a sort of rather uh with poetic license also a reference to um the strange Loop of hofstader um but in this instance speaking exactly to this recurrence so I now appreciate this is not quite the repetition compulsion it's more fundamental but the recurrence that we were talking about before in terms of revisiting states that one uh once was in um but also it's unpacked in a particular way in terms of what the physics brings to the table in in terms of different kinds of things um um and noticing that um it is certainly possible to represent your infer your own actions and that may be the first step towards a very deep model towards this irreducible um Markoff blanket uh where we can no longer represent ourselves certainly can um at subsequent or lower levels have a mechanism for understanding the feelings read as mental actions on the um the remainder um so this is a paper by me um with strange things in the title um this the S yeah um this one was interesting um I'd read this with care but it it does um provide you an entree into um to into a literature um which actually in this instance comes from fintech or financial from um formal theories in um in finance and and the like um but it has two aspects which I thought were were interesting first of all um it it sort of reiterates the the focus that at the end of the day we are quantum um or we can be read as Quantum systems so that things have a language like property in the in the in the sense that they have a certain discreetness um and secondly the implications for that um taking a slightly different view from Chris Fields when it comes to representing self and important aspects of representing self and not just in terms of self- modeling and the um the ensuing mechanisms for feelings but in the immune system it being able to recognize that this cell this kind of this antigen um belongs to me or belongs to a virus is a really important um um aspect of self representation self-recognition so I just put this paper up by Sher Marcos who is um um a fascinating writer but I repeat it this is difficult stuff but it's it does highlight biotic elements have unique digital identifiers with Geno's executing 3D self assembly for morphology and so on um and her argument uses recursive operation of self- reference um by appeal to um um godell or um you can read that godel's formulation of U of sentences uh and the implications to self-replication representation the interesting thing is she takes the argument um from math supplies them to the thy itself in the spirit of Immunology but then takes it into the realm of mirror neurons which is getting slightly closer to uh um oh leave that one yeah um just a couple of notes just to say that um you know the early work um speaking to the importance of neurom modulation and precision has a lot of empirical uh backing in terms of certainly dopamine encoding the Precision of beliefs about what I'm going to do next that have this categorical aspect so there's a lot of work um suggesting that you know things certainly things like dopamine have a profound role um in the feelings associated with things like seeking this is the work of um a group of people who are committed to understanding phenomenology in a sort of philosophical sense that highlights and I'm sure you know about this but really does highlight um the importance of precision and specifically conditioning Precision on higher level representations of self here referenced in terms of hdden mental states that themselves are um updated in accord with fairly more or less precise beliefs whose Precision themselves are um encoded by a high level so this is one example of this contextualizing um by being able to recognize yourself in certain states of mind um either subp personally or not uh that enable there are associated with the deployment of precision at lower levels and so on all the way up until you reach the this irreducible Markoff blanket so this is work high level States condition the likelihood mapping Precision at the level below so I thought this was a if you did want to sort of formalize this and start to simulate these things this is the kind of model I think you'd refer to and uh lar sfed Smith is a sort of one of the key authors in in the in that space so towards a computational phology and mental action um that right and then finally oh yeah we don't need to worry that but I I I just put that up to remind myself um that more recent leveraging of these discret State space models um now can be read purely in terms of you know inductive inference of a logical symbolic sort um which if if you like is another way of um motivating the importance of this language like way in which we um build beliefs about what we are going to do can be read uh at one level when they're very precise as intentional Behavior so I thought that might be um an interesting endorsement of the um um some of the points that were being made earlier on and would stopped my sharing that was it thank you all wonderful thank you so much so much thank you all right good luck with everything John thank you all for joining byebye yeah I understand um folks have to go can I just at least for recording sake um if folks have to go that's fine just so I can say and this so hope me remind myself what I'm saying yeah um people can depart yeah people can depart the live stream continues and then John if you want to add any closing notes yeah just so on the Adaptive Point um uh and I I I think that a lot of the resistance is just resistance uh even clinically speaking um uh but um I I think um the the the the trick and the challenge and I I I think the uh the the papers you referenced um uh and shared I I I haven't read them but um I I from how you described them I think that they uh would be approaching similar uh ideas um but the the difficulty of uh again addressing this point that sort of resists full sort of capture resists full sort of uh resolution or explanation and and how exactly to think about that especially when uh as as I said one will kind of repeat something in and it doesn't lead to uh an Adaptive outcome and yet this continues to repeat but then what to do with it in a way that allows uh someone to kind of uh enjoy a bit a bit differently or or in another way um that I think would be fine to be called um adaptive but again uh uh adaptive maybe in in in in this sense of uh maintaining these sort of different Paths of um again error uh again uh Paths of uh expected free energy that uh continue to sort of persist um uh yeah so just to kind of tie that together I I think that that's um uh the the the cannibal who makes the mistake of eating the last Cannibal and then okay what what is he to do now um with with with his oral Drive um so I'll I'll I'll stop with that but thank you again so much um this was really a a wonderful treat thank you thank you thank you you everyone bye bye thank you e
