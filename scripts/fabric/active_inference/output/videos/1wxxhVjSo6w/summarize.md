# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion between Vicente Raja and Jeff Beck explores the complexities of the free energy principle, Markov blankets, and cognitive systems.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Vicente Raja critiques the free energy principle's claims and the scope of active inference.
2. Jeff Beck emphasizes clarity in mathematical notation and rhetorical excess in FP literature.
3. The Markov blanket is essential for identifying systems and their environments.
4. Both guests agree on the importance of dynamical systems in cognitive science modeling.
5. The selection of a Markov blanket can significantly impact cognitive system interpretations.
6. The distinction between internal and external states may be an oversimplification of reality.
7. The discussion highlights the need for a better understanding of how blankets form.
8. Both guests advocate for empirical research in cognitive neuroscience and psychology.
9. The concept of resonance in perception is explored as an alternative to inferential models.
10. The conversation promotes collaborative science and the importance of converging theories.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. The free energy principle's validity is debated and requires careful interpretation.
2. Markov blankets serve as crucial tools in understanding cognitive and dynamical systems.
3. The distinction between internal and external states in cognition can be misleading.
4. Empirical research is necessary to explore the principles underlying cognitive processes.
5. The integration of different theoretical approaches can enrich the understanding of cognition.
