- The evolution of brain architectures is linked to predictive coding and active inference in cognition.
- Active inference lab is a participatory online platform for learning and practicing applied active inference.
- The paper discusses the evolutionary neurophysiological basis of cognition and complex cognitive phenotypes.
- Ant cognition is analyzed at synaptic, regional, and ecological behavioral levels over evolutionary time.
- Predictive abilities in advanced organisms have evolutionary roots, not being late additions in cognitive development.
- Simple predictive loops in ancestral brains evolved into complex cognitive functions through gradual changes.
- The paper outlines generative models for predictive perception and action in evolutionary contexts.
- Structure learning in generative models reflects evolutionary adaptations and responses to ecological pressures.
- Evolutionary changes in brain structures can be understood through algebraic operations on generative models.
- Predictive motifs in brains include homeostasis, allostasis, and simple behavioral control mechanisms.
- The homeostatic control model regulates body temperature through autonomic responses to prediction errors.
- Allostatic control anticipates environmental changes by incorporating sensory information into predictive models.
- Behavioral control mechanisms in vertebrates illustrate evolutionary continuity in action selection circuits.
- Evolutionary pressures shape cognitive complexity, with ecological niches influencing brain design and function.
- Hierarchical depth in generative models allows for multi-scale inference across temporal dimensions.
- The social brain hypothesis posits that social complexity drives the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities.
- Cognitive evolution involves the interplay between brain design, body function, and ecological demands.
- Extended cognition encompasses tools and social dimensions, transcending traditional brain-centric models.
- Future research directions include exploring the implications of generative models for understanding cognition.
- Active inference provides a framework for integrating various cognitive processes across different species.
