- Active inference integrates action and inference, enhancing our understanding of complex adaptive systems and behavior.  
- The free energy principle provides a mathematical framework for understanding multi-scale systems and their interactions.  
- Internalism and externalism are critical dichotomies in understanding how psychological and social scripts operate together.  
- Scripts are both internal cognitive structures and external behavioral categories that shape social interactions and norms.  
- The relationship between action and perception is fundamental in understanding scripts and their role in behavior.  
- Multi-scale and nested systems challenge traditional reductionist views, allowing a more holistic understanding of causation.  
- Weak scripts guide behavior probabilistically, while strong scripts provide explicit instructions for action in social contexts.  
- Active inference can unify diverse script definitions across disciplines, enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration and understanding.  
- Social scripts require shared knowledge among actors to enable cohesive and contextually appropriate behavior.  
- The intersection of internal and external perspectives enriches our understanding of social institutions and individual behavior.  
- Scripts evolve dynamically through social interactions, influenced by cultural context and ecological factors.  
- Integrating script theory with active inference offers new avenues for research in social behavior and cognitive science.  
- Empirical validation of script models can enhance psychological hypotheses regarding social behavior adherence and violations.  
- The formalization of scripts through active inference may lead to predictive models of social interaction dynamics.  
- Understanding scripts can inform interventions in mental health, governance, and community practices through structured behavioral frameworks.
