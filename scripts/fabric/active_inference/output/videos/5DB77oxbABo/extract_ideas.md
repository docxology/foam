- The active inference live stream discusses team communication and learning related to active inference.
- Team com encourages feedback for improvement and welcomes diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
- Upcoming meetings will explore two papers: "A Variational Approach to Scripts" and a mathematical paper on effective inference.
- Active inference unifies various conceptions of the script concept for research in social behavior and criminology.
- Keywords include active inference and free energy principle, emphasizing action and inference fusion.
- Internalism and externalism are key philosophical concepts in understanding active inference and script theory.
- Scripts can be internal psychological schemas or external behavioral categories influencing social interactions.
- Real systems are multi-scale and nested, transcending the internalism versus externalism debate in active inference.
- Local causal closure highlights the integrated nature of internal and external influences on behavior.
- The relationship between action and inference is fundamental in understanding script theory and social dynamics.
- Scripts guide situationally appropriate behavior based on shared knowledge among social agents.
- Different fields use scripts to study human behavior, including psychology, sociology, criminology, and anthropology.
- Weak and strong conceptions of scripts vary in their prescriptive power for situationally appropriate behavior.
- The active inference framework allows for a formal model of scripts integrating behavioral and social sciences.
- Script theory faces challenges in coherence and definition across disciplines, complicating its unified application.
- The paper proposes leveraging active inference to address the multifarious uses of scripts in human behavior studies.
- Future research should focus on formalizing scripts and testing predictions within the active inference framework.
- The integration of symbolic models with action theories is crucial for advancing script theory in cultural research.
- Active inference may improve understanding of how scripts manifest in social contexts and behavioral dynamics.
- Collaboration between script theory and active inference communities can enhance research on social scripts and human interaction.
