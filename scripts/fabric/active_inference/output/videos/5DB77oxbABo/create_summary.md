# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Daniel Friedman introduces the active inference live stream, focusing on script theory and its implications for social behavior research.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Active Inference Live Stream aims to enhance online team communication and learning.
2. Discussions will cover two upcoming papers on script theory and mathematical modeling.
3. The concept of "scripts" relates to behavioral patterns in various fields, including criminology.
4. Internalism and externalism are key philosophical themes in understanding scripts and behavior.
5. Scripts can be internal psychological schemas or external behavioral categories.
6. The paper aims to unify various interpretations of "scripts" across disciplines using active inference.
7. Weak and strong conceptions of scripts differentiate between explicit instructions and general tendencies.
8. Active inference can enhance understanding of social dynamics and interactions between agents.
9. The framework addresses the complexity of social behaviors and their contextual influences.
10. Future discussions will explore integrating script theory with active inference research and applications.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding scripts can improve insights into social behavior across disciplines.
2. The internalism-externalism debate is crucial for framing active inference discussions.
3. Active inference offers a formal model to unify diverse script interpretations.
4. Weak scripts allow for flexible behavioral responses based on contextual cues.
5. Collaboration between script theory and active inference can lead to innovative research applications.
