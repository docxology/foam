# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The tutorial on active inference models focuses on empirical applications, parameter estimation, model comparison, and the significance of individual differences in behavior.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The tutorial is part four of a series on active inference and empirical applications.
2. Active inference models aim to make methods accessible to a broader audience.
3. Participants perform tasks to generate data for model fitting and parameter estimation.
4. Parameter estimation algorithms compare participant behavior against model predictions.
5. Model comparison identifies the best fitting model using Bayesian approaches.
6. Parameters must be recoverable for reliable individual difference measures.
7. Variational Bayesian methods help prevent overfitting in parameter estimation.
8. The relationship between parameters and behavioral outcomes can inform clinical practices.
9. Group-level analyses can reveal differences in parameters across clinical populations.
10. Future sessions could explore specific papers or detailed methodologies in active inference.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the principles of active inference enhances empirical research methodologies.
2. Parameter estimation is crucial for modeling individual differences in behavior.
3. Bayesian model comparison provides a robust framework for evaluating model performance.
4. Collaborating with supervisors who align with research interests fosters better outcomes.
5. Further exploration of active inference can lead to innovative clinical applications.
