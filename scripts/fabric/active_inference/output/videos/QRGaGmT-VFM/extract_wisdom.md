# QUOTES:
- "The kind of whole purpose of this tutorial... was to try to make methods for actually building active inference models."
- "We've covered the basics of active inference... what the motivation is for doing active inference."
- "The frontier in active inference at the moment is... figuring out how to get these models to hit the road."
- "The explore-exploit task that we'll be showing... requires that you seek out information before you can really know."
- "This is where you would change your prior means and your prior variances."
- "The actual values of these absolute value of these are not really informative."
- "It’s important to realize too that typically the model that will win will be simpler than the true underlying generative process."
- "The posterior estimates are tracking what you want them to be."
