# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion explores distinctions between cognition, thinking, and knowing while integrating neuroscience, active inference, and surprise theory.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Distinction between cognition, thinking, and knowing involves different nuances and interpretations.
2. Cognition is seen as a conscious state, while thinking is an action-oriented process.
3. Active inference framework relates neuroscience to various fields beyond just cognitive science.
4. Variational free energy minimizes surprise in cognitive models, aiding decision-making processes.
5. Psychological surprise differs from Bayesian surprise, affecting how we interpret observations.
6. Active inference considers altered states of consciousness and their impact on perception.
7. The complexity of computing expected free energy increases with policy length and options.
8. Generative models help evaluate relationships between internal beliefs and external observations.
9. Entropy represents average surprise, indicating how dispersed a distribution is.
10. Future discussions will focus on Markov blanket formalism and principles of surprise minimization.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding the distinctions among cognition, thinking, and knowing is essential for clarity in cognitive science.
2. Active inference serves as a versatile modeling framework applicable across multiple disciplines.
3. Surprise theory has significant implications for understanding human perception and decision-making.
4. Complexity in cognitive modeling arises from the need to evaluate numerous possible policies.
5. Future discussions will deepen understanding of active inference in relation to neural processes and actions.
