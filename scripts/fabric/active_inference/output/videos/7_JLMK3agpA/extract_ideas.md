# IDEAS

- The livestream discusses stochastic chaos and Markov blankets in an active inference context.
- Actin Flab Lab aims to communicate and practice applied active inference through participatory discussions.
- The focus of the livestream is to introduce ideas from the paper by Friston et al. (2021).
- Key questions include modeling thingness in chaotic dynamics and the concept of system sentience.
- Sentience is defined as internal states inferring external states, relating to the intentional stance.
- A Markov blanket is a statistical construct isolating internal states from external influences.
- The paper aims to derive a Markov blanket from a normal form of stochastic chaos.
- The concept of flow is explored in various contexts, including physical, informational, and psychological.
- The authors discuss Bayesian mechanics and its relevance to statistical modeling and inference.
- Thermodynamics is introduced as a branch of physics relating energy, heat, and statistical mechanics.
- The paper examines the implications of stochastic chaos on understanding dynamical systems.
- The Helmholtz decomposition is applied to relate dynamical models to probability densities.
- Conditional independence underlies the structure of Markov blankets and influences system dynamics.
- The free energy principle is highlighted as a variational principle for understanding system behavior.
- The research aims to establish a mathematical basis for understanding sentience in self-organizing systems.
- The authors suggest the potential for neural network architectures to facilitate active inference modeling.
- The implications of the study extend to time series analysis and modeling of real-world processes.
- The overall goal is to reduce uncertainty in understanding complex systems through active inference methodologies.
