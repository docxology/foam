# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter 7 explores advanced models in active inference, focusing on hidden Markov models, decision-making processes, and learning dynamics.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Chapter 7 introduces models for categorical variables in discrete time with increasing complexity.
2. Hidden Markov models are central to perceptual processing and decision-making experiments.
3. The chapter discusses the evolution of beliefs over time through Bayesian belief updating.
4. Decision-making models incorporate policies and expected free energy to guide actions.
5. Active inference balances exploration and exploitation through a unified cost function.
6. Factorization in models allows for multiple outcomes and sensory modalities to be inferred.
7. Learning occurs through hierarchical inference and offline updating of beliefs over time.
8. The concept of epistemic and pragmatic values informs decision-making and information seeking.
9. The chapter illustrates how models can adapt to different time scales of learning.
10. Structure learning enables agents to update their beliefs even without new sensory data.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding hidden Markov models is crucial for building actor inference models.
2. Exploration and exploitation are integrated into a single framework in active inference.
3. Learning is a slow process that involves updating beliefs based on prior experiences.
4. Hierarchical models can provide insights into complex cognitive behaviors and emotional responses.
5. Offline learning can enhance model efficiency by refining beliefs without new input.
