# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter 4 explores the relationship between free energy and Bayesian inference, emphasizing mathematical frameworks and applications in active inference models.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The chapter introduces the connection between free energy and Bayesian inference.
2. Active inference models use generative models for understanding perception and action.
3. It discusses the importance of approximate inference due to computational limitations.
4. Jensen's inequality facilitates the computation of free energy as an upper bound on surprise.
5. Factor graph notation is used to represent static perception models and active inference.
6. The chapter covers discrete and continuous time models in active inference.
7. Agents act to minimize free energy, impacting their environment and observations.
8. Expected free energy balances exploratory and exploitative behaviors in agents.
9. Marov blankets help separate agents from their environments for effective inference.
10. The chapter serves as a precursor to more complex concepts in later chapters.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding free energy is crucial for grasping active inference models.
2. Approximate inference is necessary for biological plausibility in computational models.
3. The balance between exploration and exploitation is key to effective decision-making.
4. Mathematical foundations, such as Jensen's inequality, are integral to active inference.
5. Factor graphs provide a valuable framework for representing complex relationships in models.
