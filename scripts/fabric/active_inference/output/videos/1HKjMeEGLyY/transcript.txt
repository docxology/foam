hello welcome to the active inference lab this is math stream 1.1 our first math stream and we're really lucky today to be able to have some time with shauna dobson and we're going to be talking about emergent time and chromatic types and hear a lot more on this topic and also check in with everyone's questions that are in the live chat or in the comments later but first we'll just quickly introduce ourselves and then hear a presentation and then have a discussion so again i'm daniel and i'm here with my co-organizer sarah so maybe sarah say hi and then pass it off uh hey um sarah calling in from walk down forever berlin germany and um i'm looking forward to talking to shayna dobson hey sarah thank you thank you for a nice intro hello everyone my name is shanna and uh i am uh i'll be a graduate student in the fall but i've studied a whole bunch of stuff in the middle um i'm kind of a i guess a polymath that got a bunch of degrees at once and um did a masters and i'm a i was hired right away as a full-time lecturer kind of everywhere and um found a couple topics that i'm pretty interested in so let's see if uh if this can be exciting for someone shayna dobson sorry okay daniel can you see this okay yep all right am i ready to go okay good um great all right so i want to talk about um emergent time and chromatic types and you know maybe um i mean it's up to y'all if you want to ask me questions as i go or maybe hold them because i'm trying to constellate uh what's going on here you're gonna see there's some heavy topics involved but i try to make them um as beautiful and palatable as i can so uh let's just get right to it what are these and what am i talking about so i have a few questions um kind of driving this independent of the mathematics i'm trying to make this not super math focused i was trying to make this kind of more applicable to everyone because the math that i do is super niche and i was trying to not do that and be like a non-inclusive so the big questions the philosophy questions that are driving me is what is time um is there anything that isn't time time is always modeled as either just like a geiger counter or it's this sort of accepted background phenomena and i don't really agree with that i feel like we haven't focused too much on it people think like where is it you know i ask like uh sometimes i give talks and my uh my first uh question is like where is yesterday and of course people like what you know you could zoom out and look at like the light you know the light cone data and things like that but it's like phenomenologically really interesting where is it and you know uh will it always be here and i remember i was talking to rafael bouzou and he's got this great paper about like you know i mean is it will it always be here and maybe it's not um maybe it it sort of just maybe you know it came at some point as well hence i think it's sort of emergent so and i like wasn't always here and here's probably not the appropriate word you're going to see that i love language so again i'm super poly math and i a lot of my math papers are super math philosophy and so i think there's a lot of problematic terms that we need to actually go into and so i actually say where's non-archimedean time you know so um not an archimedean the you know the uh to be archimedean is to believe in infinite decimals that you can always have a number bigger or lower and in quantum mechanics you really have a cut off right so if quantum mechanics is modeling you know cut-offs as um you know spatial cut-outs as non-archimedean why is time not also non-archimedean so i'm very interested in that what would that actually look like let me go heavy into that so um you know sarah i had the iliyah that's derrida in the french continental philosophy saying that there's always a there is in mathematics we always go there exists you know there exists an x such that whatever and so that's very powerful the existential quantifier right but and qualifier but i'm you know what are the conditions for existence this is something chris fields and i are working on like you what are those not just like metabolic conditions i mean all of this you know so i think the big bang is a real problem and uh like going into that of course you have all these wild theories about you know well you know it's like a a white you know like a white hole that passed through something else and all this kind of stuff but i'm really interested in like what are the conditions to even have existence right so uh what what would the conditions be to have a discretization of time what does that even mean so what is entropy and a temporal discretization so we have this like very vague notion of entropy and i agree with uh like max tegmark that there is no objective notion of entropy you're like oh well there's a local you know influx of energy here but you know uh the environment surrounding it lost energy so there seems to be a calibration there you know so my whole point is to uh categorify the stop mechanism just like chris talked about in his last talk um you know biologically speaking like when to stop uh like you know cellularly dividing the the stop mechanism on the bio level is very very very intricate in my opinion and so i'm wondering like how would you categorify that i mean like using category theory uh so i'm my whole vibe here is to try to actually upgrade the mathematics that's used in modeling some of these things again my head is pretty abstract so i see things abstractly but i think it's a gift because it's allowing me to see connections in a non-linear way so my brain is definitely non-linear and i try to use that in linear phenomena so i say you know how can we say you know there exists a time asymmetry but it uses this like phrase well when there is no objective notion of entropy i think it's really really tricky there's also no proven structural causality all right and sarah you had this you know the light cone it's a little vague right there's some problems uh with gr there's some problems with the formulation of light cone and things like that um light cones wouldn't withstand quantum mechanics and stuff like this so um i firmly believe you know just like bertrand russell that there is no structural causality and it leads you into these great things like last thursday-ism and you know the world was made five minutes ago and there's really no logical impossibility in saying that so i have not seen a structural causality and so again chris fields and i agree with this and that's why we're writing this cool stuff number eight why do we actually experience memories this is actually um like why a lot of this is very um again taken for granted and so i'm really interested in like why that is of course people say you have memories to prevent you from you know falling off a cliff again like association and base pavlovian uh you know survival and that's not what i'm talking about right i'm actually talking about re like how why do you experience them somebody like me like a total precog like i remember everything and sometimes i can get you know haunted by thoughts like memories that just come come in and i um i know there's a lot of people like that maybe you're just taking a test and these horrible memories just fly in your head or maybe they're really good memories right but the experience of that is very strange nobody knows what a thought is right i remember sarah i think you asked in ser and chris's talk you know what what is a thought and i've i haven't heard anything about what those are people oh quantum fluctuations and things like this yeah but there's something else going on because you know for instance like the speech that i just said i read number eight like two minutes ago and uh so the speech is gone right it dies but something remains and so uh what is that it seems like there's a hologram copy of everything that you say that's actually stored in the brain and you're doing some kind of recall with that but i don't understand storage if everything is discrete and so that's why this is very complex and very beautiful so i say what what are they like what is the fundamental unit of thought you know alan watts is going to say so oh it's like existence and i'm not really sure what the bio people are going to say what is it you know um what is not a thought you know so for me you're going to see that i'm going to invoke this pro finite condition a pro finite set is a um a compact totally disconnected space it's so it's it's like a canter set so i think that what's happening is time is like a canter set and somehow you are recalling over a cantor set what is a thought that no idea right um no idea how we're even speaking to each other so i think we actually need to go over what that is these are just the questions having begun the talk right so questions two right what is causality like what is it again if i don't believe in structure you know oh a came before b that's very reference frame dependent and reference frames are flimsy right and so i say well causality for him and then i say well what is a measurement that's very tricky right of course the quantum problem and um just measurement in general yeah and i say well what is a reference frame that's even worse um you know according to me my world according to me and like who is me and so that's going to be tricky so chris and i you know both agree like what is this personal identity over time and you've got big branches of philosophy like pedurantism and endurances i'm trying to just trying to figure out what that is right uh who is this right uh is is me today the same as me yesterday well clearly not because the cells are doing a whole bunch of things right we don't have any of the same cells that we used to have i mean maybe some neuronal things but um you know you have a boundary and so what's happened so i you know i don't understand what over time means i don't know how anyone can be over anything so then you know um sarah i said well isn't you know uh shouldn't you talk about space time and i'm like that's just a manifold it's like one of the most basic structures in mathematics and we have more sophisticated mathematics so i don't really vibe with uh the manifold thought i think you can really really sparkle and dazzle that up to see what's actually happening i don't know if you actually have to unify them like that you know um you could just be spatializing time instead of leaving time as it is so then i'm like okay if you want to just use like uh manifold and differential geometry you could also go number theory so like what would a number theoretic time look like and what would like a number theoretic space look like so you don't have to just like my whole point is that physics like the the framing of physics is based on the mathematics at the current time so a lot of quantum mechanics is like linear algebra and operator theory but you could also up that and make it like algebraic number theory and then you'd get new physics so with me if you give new math you get new physics so upgrade the maths you know so like what is a number theoretic black hole that sounds a lot cooler to me than the you know the the framing of the black hole the old model has a lot of problems can you also like see me okay yep okay cool all right so let's go through this outline and again i'll just keep the talk um at like an hour and then um all right so here we go so those are my like big questions kind of funneling everything um so i'll talk about discrete time i'm going to really firmly say that there is no synchronous reference that everything that's happening now already happened you do have like a lot of time in the brain to process so there is nobody's experiencing anything as it is and things like that i'm also going to say that there really is no self reflexivity because i i don't know if that there's a self and so chris and i are trying to actually formulate all this together right so i really don't think there is a productism or an endurantism with those two philosophies that are trying to say you know that you exist as a four-dimensional being and you kind of exist through time and i think there's some problems with that so problems within produrantism or endurance is like oh i get cut and i have a reaction later those those pieces of you were supposed to be independent but they're not we're in touch with our pain but they would say that it's like not so it's it's a little tricky um i think there is no personal identity over time i have no idea how this is happening there's like a reset happening every every um every whatever you may not want to say plank time but if there's not personal identity over time there's definitely you know so i think uh the memory whatever it is has a singular support the support is the um the um the the you know places where a function is not zero so if you only have singular support then that means you're not zero on a singular set so it's actually uh again i'm i'm trying to upgrade the mathematics used in all of this to fractals and cantor sets things like that i'll introduce chromatic types and chromatic types is going to be this new spin that i'm working on um that's sort of paralleling what's called a homotopy type a new holographic principle based on these diamonds uh that i really like and emergent time okay so for the why how and to what extent that i was asked to kind of fill out i said why because this day there does not exist a coherent formalism of emergent time nor discretization of time imagine there is no continuum right that's a huge uh it's a huge statement what exists actually between the discretization what is emergence how can we again our complexity class complexity class in the sense of turing degrees that's what i'm referring to so not equivalence classes sarah but like the turing degree equivalent that you still have this like there is and that's the physics of time equivalent of a meaningful president but it's absent of all kazoo stream because industry is like a softest tree we have a we have lots of physics sophistry and mathematical sophistry and i'm like can we actually try to figure out how we can actually uh have existence with this uh discretization of time independent of any kind of conniving you know so how well we're gonna you know hopefully have a wondrous introduction discretization mathematically all that is uh commissioner with it okay so um i'm into a lot of uh mathematics um where you can construct spaces based on algebraic spaces so i'm going to try to go really lightly through this because this is pretty heavy but um so you can quotient out a scheme which is like a higher dimensional notion of an algebraic variety by a pro-ital equivalence relation pro tells us a certain topology an equivalence relation is going to be a gluing so you get this diamond which is a sheaf on a category in a category called perfectoid spaces so this diamond has these quote impurities which are these geometric points i refer to so this is a notion from peter schulza and i really like the the diamond idea and um so what happens that you have this uh this geometric point which is a morphism of schemes and it's almost like um so it's it's sort of like this that there are mathematical impurities in this object and so when you have a normal diamond uh you have you know different colors on it that are reflections of the impurities but you don't ever actually see the impurity itself you just see the reflections of the impurities and so you're never actually getting the thing you're actually only getting shifted versions of a reflection that's what i think is going on here right so you have your uh you know your interface and no one's ever actually experiencing the thing just a profiling many copies so you could you can pull this morphism of a scheme back which is a topological move and you can get this what's called a profanity many copies of spa see this is the attic spectrum of an algebraically closed curve so you can make these products spa c cross s underline for s underline being a pro finite set which i described earlier so you can get these awesome products and um this is this is the new like model that i use to uh write um this cool paper with my awesome colleague robert pretner about a new model of consciousness where it's like okay this is what's going on you know you have profiling many copies of this of a perception it's you're not really perceiving so um but that that's pretty deep that's the some of the hardest math on the planet it's like looking at sheaves on um a category so discretized time right so something i came up with just a bit ago was like there you know there really is no you can't really say a equals b whatever you want to say that really what you're saying is a equals b up to some condition x where x is what is called a homotopy type so type theory is like uh pretty rampant in the in like um lots of like awesome models and so a homotopic type is going to be like it's an equivalence it's an equivalence um based on homotopies which are deformations between two spaces so you can say a is equivalent to b if criterion x is considered so you have to be really careful with the statement equals yeah and so really we really only have intersubjective agreement on certain metrics so i really think there is no equality for anything you just have a bunch of agents agreeing on these metrics right um the brilliant don hoffman has a bunch of work on that too and um i was working in his uh research group for a bit so you know i think that mentation these biological processes i just give a um a talk on like mentation and a certain homotopy type um that it actually works in discrete time so how are you actually going to do that how can you actually model memory and biological functions over a discretized time that looks like a bunch of dots so that looks like memory of a singular support and you're going to have to really figure out how you could get words and things like that so what i'm going to do is like introduce those chromatic types so again there's no personal identity over time i think you only have chromatic towers of localization i'll go over that but in your singular support you're doing what's called a localization localization is a way of adding inverses um you know for instance the integers right if you want to add like inverses to the integers you need to get something like the rational numbers so to add inverses is a way of making a space more full i'll say and then also you can take categories which have morphisms and you can make the morphisms isomorphism which means they're invertible so localization's pretty powerful so again there really is no personal identity uh you know there's only personal identity up to time i also think i don't know time may be just the up to condition for you to exist you are in essence localizing at each point of the singular supports and i think i wrote yeah i've wrote a little paper about this that should be out in the journal cognitive science so hopefully it's there so what is this so homotopy type is a topological space regarded up to weak homotopia equivalence um uh what okay so it's a topological space regarded up to um you know uh how you know um how you can actually equate various objects in the space and what's called an infinity groupoid um you know you can get an infinity groupoid where all the morphisms are actually so all the maps are actually invertible so we call a weak homotopia equivalents a map between topological spaces which induces isomorphisms on all the homotopic groups the homotropic groups are encoding um the homotopy behavior and so say that's in that book that i recommended to you so groups so we're familiar with groups you know that you know where symmetries relate an object to itself and but a group void you have symmetries acting between more than one object as you can see in this like this visual so i've got a b c d these are multiple objects and you have maps going everywhere so um a groupoid is a category where all the morphisms are isomorphisms so if i have an infinity groupoid it means i have an infin infinite morphisms so infinite isomorphisms so the big idea for the chromatic type is to actually put a chromatic tower over a temporal logic we're all familiar with temporal logic and you're going to see what i mean by this tower so i think you can actually create chromatic types instead of a homotopy type so we're going to be interested in creating these chromatic spaces that have their own notion of localization and then you can get a new idea of time so localizing a geometric homotopic so again i told you localization is a way of adding inverses in category theory that means you want to make your maps isomorphisms so we say given a category c in a class w of morphisms we seek the localization c w inverse you can get a reflective localization what you do is you localize which means add inverses you complete the space what if that's a koshi space like if you want to get sequences to converge and then you take the inverse limit which is gluing you're going to see i do a lot of gluing so for a category a category is a collection of objects and morphisms and you have an associativity condition and an identity arrow so homotopies again are maps ways to get ways to get objects to be equivalents and there's all kinds of ways that you can do that so i'm interested in something called topological localization so this is another type of topic localization so we say a topological localization is a left exact localization and again i'm going to go very gentle with some of these definitions left exact localization of an infinity one category so that's a category of infinite morphisms um in the sense of passing to what's called a reflective sub infinity one category at a collection of morphisms that are monomorphisms so um with the details are of course they're important but for uh the the whole point is that you have a reflective subcategory what's that reflective subcategory it's a full subcategory such that the objects d and the morphisms have reflections in the category so that's very cool so the objects and the morphisms have reflections every object in d looks at its own reflection by a certain morphism t d to td and the reflection of an object c and c is actually equipped with an isomorphism so that's great the inclusion creates all limits and it has all cool limits which de-admits so the to say that you have limits and co-limits means that your category is sort of a very very nicely well behaved so this is very neat that in the reflective subcategory it seems very apropos to pair that with the diamond work that i'm trying to do because uh the diamond is dealing with profinetly made copies of these reflections and the reflective subcategory you know contains uh reflections of the actual object so it's a very very special um subcategory so again the whole idea is to get okay so maybe at every moment you are actually topologically localizing and so that actually means you're actually just looking at your own reflections all the time which you are right there's a lot of maxims that say you know you see what you are absolutely so um i'd still you know so i'm using all of that beautiful mathematics to actually justify a statement that you know would only like without the mathematics the statement would just be like a sentence and i can actually try to justify it structurally so i think you're actually localizing time as these kinds of equivalences so there really is no well-defined notion of metric you really just have uh you know why why are we working in topological spaces because the metrics are very subjective and so you work topologically or you don't really have a notion of metric but you have a closeness condition so everyone works topologically and i'm trying to categorify the notion of time and space means to throw it into category theory let's talk about its morphisms and how you localize it and how you invert the morphisms so you need to ask huh you know so topological spaces you have a topology on a space so here right with the like the diamond i put it you know like um you know peter puts a sheath on a you know in a category like okay so what are open sets in a category that's actually not trivial right like um so you know i say the construction of the topological localization seems appropriately meta in its construction of a reflection of what is already profinitely many copies i say the word v stack it's a higher notion of a diamond and i'll go into that a little bit later so the the second meta question is how would you actually put a topology like on an infinity one category that's hard right you have to actually figure out what the open sets are in a category right and so uh basic point set topology and like anything in hatcher is going to go over you know topological spaces and topologies but to actually get one on a category that's not so easy so there is something called an infinity one site on an infinity one category it's the data encoding an infinity one category of infinity one sheaves the sheaves see the pre-sheaves inside a certain category of pre-sheaves um so um these are just like i said in chris's talk these are like ways of monitoring kind of local data around a space sheets are attached to certain spaces and so we call um a topology on a category of site so what's this chromatic tower well the chromatic tower looks like this so um it's actually there's a whole bunch of work on chromatic homotopy theory just plugging this in but what is that right it's a way of identifying spaces using these chromatic towers so given this ln this is a boost field localization of what's called a maraba k theory so these k theories are ways of looking at isomorphism classes of vector bundles you have a wedge sum there um and uh so this localization gluing right localization is adding inverses um so given that we call the the homotopy limit over the chromatic tower so there's a tower of these things called spectra which are objects that behave like co homology theories and chromology theories are exploring holes in spaces and just kind of data nice invariants about space because you want to classify these spaces and so you have these towers based on the levels of spectra so this is mo this is what i'm uh when i say the p localization of a spectrum that's uh it's pretty detailed but uh we're saying like it's localized with respect to a certain p and so without without like super going into the details of that you have uh towers of equivalences and so based on your layer based on where you are on the chromatic tower is what you're going is how you're going to be navigating so that's memory space to me recall memory space it's all the same navigating your touring degree is is in a sense a chromatic tower like this so to create a chromatic type i'm going to make uh equivalences based on the layers of this tower so for instance you know if you're on the top layer making a an equivalence between the top layer and uh you know um so replacing home never replacing but upgrading the homotopy type with chromatic type okay so we say for memories and computability i said uh again at that mentation talk that i just gave not too long ago at the biological conference what else besides computing might be involved in biological mentality right i'm just going a little um phenomenological so we can pull this together but you know it's a it's a homotopic type that could be a chromatic type it proceeds by weak equivalences it far exceeds there's a lot of like expander graphs and graph theory that model it i just think it's insufficient and i think that you can get into these towers and get a little more of what's going on so i also say memory proceeds like an almost apology that's a very strict word from faultings uh what it means to be almost but we can say that memory has a singular support like i told you like a cantor set and it's what's called a descent condition in my opinion which is a gluing right so memory is recall and it's putting everything together so you can actually localize at this specific instant whatever that is and so it behaves more like a descent condition so again a weak equivalence is a class of morphisms in a specific category computability right so there's a bunch of uh stuff there's a huge msri awesome msri conference um a program um during 2020 about decidability definability and computability so computability right is the ability to solve a problem in an effective manner you've got all these calculuses turing computable weaker automata stronger hyper computation i say you know i think it's the actual ability to to construct descent conditions so i think we need to take these very strict terms about how we navigate and categorify them so you see me kind of adding like well why don't we upgrade that upgrade the mathematics used there um you know define abilities about structuring knowledge and concept formation decidability say binary decision problem is decidable there is just an effective method for deriving the correct answer you know and this it's very uh this is very kind of um clearly not you know this is not what i was giving you in the chromatic tower i think there's more ways of getting around and saying things are actually effective if you use this sort of weak equivalence kind so memory so what else besides information algorithms are involved in biological mentality well a lot you've got geometric logic girdle and completeness singular support right so i call this um in my paper with robert we come up with a nested hierarchy of awarenesses and i'll go over that in about one second so i call it a oneness one awareness's capacity to construct morphisms between other one awarenesses so we're all relating consciousness whatever it is is geometrical and relational i don't think it's a computational so you can get this categorical i'm trying to figure out a way oh you know we know the notion of turing degrees let's get a categorical notion of that so um you know i say recall your ability to recall is what's called a localization sequence this is a co-fiber sequence where you have these maps and you have a condition between functors and what pops out is a fiber and so you given so this is what i think is happening when you actually recall you look for a certain state out pops a memory right so there's a bunch of category theory going on so what are the fundamental units of life that's very tricky right um there's a lot of um i think there's a story about like a beautiful monk that went up to a hill to just um sort of self desiccate and everyone thought he passed away but maybe he had one heartbeat a year so my question is like what what is that what are the fundamental units of life could it be that someone slips under the radar of what we would call metabolic life but there's another set of brain waves that are maybe mirror symmetries on the other side so like you see i have this chromatic tower with everything on the right side i want to build a what's on the left side so all of this i have chromatic towers with right sides yeah so maybe this is the condition of life and what if you reflect it on the other side what does that even mean um so again i'm you know playing around uh trying to figure out levels of consciousness so for instance clyde wearing the famous case um awesome pianist right super brilliant pianist um got an um i think an hpv and got an h like uh got a retrograde amnesia and so he's got a seven second memory and he only has motor memory and no personal memory right so you can be like you know he'll say i've never seen a doctor before in my life and he's visited by doctors all the time so it's very interesting with someone like that you have to ask the conditions of what are clive waring's fundamental units of life and i literally think what you could you can more easily categorize what's going on rather than just saying retrograde amnesia maybe some layers in the tower layers in the chromatic tower have been uh gone and that's what's happening so if layers in the chromatic tower are cut then you actually have uh you know so just like a geometric way of interpreting all of this okay so let's get to discrete time right so discrete time why do we model time as continuous like why again i think it's an overlook and um i just think we haven't focused on it so why do we model time as a counter or as the background for some kind of you know background dependent model right um what i have pictured here is what's called a spectral sequence and so if time looks like these series of dots inside the dot is encoded a whole bunch of information about a space so you could model time as like a modulized space and that's what i said um when chris gave us tall right so that points they're not just points right they actually encode other information but you can see that there are gaps between the points so if you model time as uh discontinuous or you know or discretized um what's actually in between the gaps so then we say okay well quantum mechanics model space is a non-our comedian field why is time also not not our comedian why not so i opened with that question what would it mean to phenomenologically have a discrete time what would exist between like t1 and t2 that's really rich what's actually there maybe suskin would say that's the pyramid emergence right he's got the two black holes entangled he thinks emergence comes from the entanglement black hole so everyone's looking at that and then you get paternitism and temporal parts again it tells you where you exist across time just like you exist across space so um i you know i asked why do we experience memories is time entangled with memory where does entanglement end that's my question how would memories actually exist in discrete time that's tricky that's tricky right so again you have someone like me who thinks there is no personal identity over time but yet you have a memory right somehow um so anyway so how would you actually define memories in end time i don't think there's just one timeline here so i put together this theory where i think you have the the levels of time you have is depending on the levels of category that you are and so i'm going to go over that so the levels of time that you are able to navigate depends on your complexity class and the level of uh space that you can actually navigate so how would we experience memories in an end time imagine you had n levels of time in a tower so uh with roberts and our pluralist manus paper and also the perfecto diamond paper right we'd say you know awareness is a it's i we can do it representationally say it's a representation of a pneuma non but we also want to throw consciousness into levels and layers so right here you have a basic notion of a one category where i have objects and i have morphisms between objects that's it so one category is contains objects and one morphism so just a quick category theory like um category is beautiful and i cannot do it justice in two seconds but i'm given just a little recap of what we need in the middle here you see a two category two category contains objects one morphisms and what we call two morphism so two morphisms or morphisms between the morphisms you see i have a map here from f1 to g2 so this fee and you see i have a gamma here from f2 to g1 so that's this is getting what i think's right so basic basic complexity class can only oh hi daniel hi sarah we have an interaction that's it right but super precogs or anyone with total recall like me i can put a map between this interaction in this interaction this is what i'm talking about a three category three category looks like this you have objects you have morphisms between the objects you have morphisms between the one morphisms and you have a three morphism which is a morphism between the two morphisms you can see this f2 going this way right so this is what i'm saying right depending on your level of category your level of awareness if you are a three awareness creature you're able to to navigate this way and so that's why i said so if you're a three awareness creature you live in three time if you're a one awareness creature you live in one time um and again i just i just went on to this because people like me are either haunted by you know sad memories or blessed by amazing memories and time for me did not seem to go linearly it goes like this so we have this first subjective experience we have this nested categories of representation you've got a one awareness you've got a two awareness so that means a category of categories of representation the three awareness a category of category of categories of representation in awareness is our top a categories of categories of categories so you can see that what what what does this sort of correspond to is like well me giving you this awesome presentation being welcome in your environment and uh us also you know uh being at the cambridge apostles and having like tea you know so not just being able to imagine something like that but being able to partition your brain and split your consciousness and to actually be able to do that so i'm all i'm really excited about splitting consciousness and trying to physically be in multiple places because i don't think i don't think there's only one timeline here but to split consciousness you'd have to be able to do this in the brain you know um which is cool so we come up with so along with in time and so again you can see that with the mathematics you're able to do a lot of stuff here so within time i came up with this so you know what i think according to end time you'd have a pro finite language like what is that well if you you know any dairy dog piece or anything like a in his of hermetology it's going to show you that the the glossomatics or the gloss seems you know your fundamental units of language if you open them up there's not a lot there but actually the process of reading is a trace it's a wild phenomena because you're pulling together uh so many pieces so we actually uh i came up with this awesome language scheme that was like well you know uh in in the one space you just have your normal i we you know uh me my mine but in n2 you'd have like a one eye a two eyes this is if you're in two awareness right if you're in the two category then you would have actually like a one eye a two eye a one me a two me if you're in a three category you'd have a one eye a two eye a three eye a one me a two me so instead of just she her there'd be like three she three her and i think that's the level of intricacy in the new language so getting to some of the physics stuff and uh going into the emergent time um so i came up with this uh idea for a perfecto dictionary again perfectoid spaces or peter schultz's brilliant work and i just think it's amazing and uh so i do think uh quantum physics needs to be a little revolutionized by replacing hilbert's space for the perfectoid space replacing state vectors the geometric points and i just gave this a talk at ucla's ipam entropy conference not too long ago and i think it was pretty well received replace the tensor product with the diamond product placed non-locality with the profinet and many copies of spa c replace superposition with these pro-ital sheaves and pro-finite sets the collapse of the wave function was such so tricky uh replace it with a what's called a tilting operation which takes us from characteristic zero to characteristic p you get these also perfectoid modular curves replace upgrade the holographic principle with the six functor formalism which is a groth and deconstruction and i'm about to show you that you can replace quantum topology upgrade it with this a tell commonology replace operator out again it's great but you can just upgrade stuff so i shouldn't say replace but upgrade let's let's let's uh let's replace operator algebra with a non-therian uh version and unitarity with a a certain descent data so you have this uh this is uh peter's um um six functor formalism where in a six functor formalism it is a way of making a theory i would say really um it's um uh it's a a a notion of um replacing poincare uh normal point correct duality with abelian chief comology and it's something called verdier duality so there's dualities going on here which is why i thought it'd be great to pair it with the holographic principle because the holographic principle is really fortified by juan maldocina's ads cft proposed duality between you know uh um like the gauge gravity duality so you have this uh fmfk theory thing that i'm working on of a diamond and you have these uh the six operations and so with these six operations these are just image functors between sheaves and um you get this notion this is what i'm thinking of so uh in quantum gravity right you have the holographic principle and it's still very kind of loosely um defined and it's it's it's a given and only a negative condition like defined by what it's not and so i think the holographic principle instead of having um ads you know anti-sitter space in the middle and the conformal field theory in the bulk that you could actually have the six functor formalism in the middle and the profinitely many copies like the diamonds um looking like the conformal field theorem this is what i'm working on right now so emergent time um so these v stacks these are higher dimensional diamonds and so they're certainly holographic uh in a sense that they encode already profoundly many copies of data that's already multiple on two fronts so um a v stack is a two sheaf so this is like you know the sheaths that hold you in cold encode local data so this now it's it's a it's one category up uh it takes values in categories rather than sets so you know you're going to have to shift to v stack if you want to do uh this profiling language so um here's a conjecture with chris and i you know we're trying to generalize the distinction between separable and entangled this is not easy um so once again recall that the geometric points in the diamond amorphism of schemes there's something called a bearwise silicon and infomorphism and this is an adjoint pair um and so okay so you have an adjoint pair these are sort of like inverses like inverse functions uh but they're um functors and so we extend this idea to the two adjoint pairs um this is f upper star um rf uh lower star for the derived category and then f lower shriek and f upper shriek shriek is a kind of slang for the punctuation so those are referring to once again the peter's operations so that's the grand correspondence right is going to be this um this derived category which consists precisely of the atel sheaves of these certain modules for a small diamond okay so let's get to emergent time so how what am i i'm gonna use all this how do i actually pull this together so if you consider the simplest case we say an event what is an event it's a i'm going to call it a topological localization of any particular reference frame right event is normally like i don't know simultaneity or says something like that try not to use the word simultaneity so we'll say a topological localization of somebody's reference frame let's consider that to be a point in the diamond topological space on that point is a certain site i told you right that's how you're going to get a topology we're going to call this site the pro hotel site the category of pro finite sets s so this is from more of peter's work on condensed mathematics so global time emerges as a set of continuous maps from all pro finite sets s to t so again you have these chopped up notions of time and you can get global time to emerge as the set of continuous maps from again the all the pro finite cantor sets back to t back to the topological space so global time could be considered as a sheaf of sets on this pro hotel site and that's called a condensed set based on his work with uh um clausen so emergent time results in passing to the larger category of she's to consider a condensed version of this is an f theory construction i don't want to go over too much it's a little deep so a second conjectural way to get an emergent time you can actually use diamonds and take equivalence relations of those to actually get uh the v stacks so again when i showed you the definition of diamond you took um equivalence relations of you to protel equivalence relations well let's upgrade and you can take actually equivalence relations of diamonds to get modulized spaces of v stacks that's pretty big so there's new work being done about how do you actually you know how about a new algebra this is peter and dustin's new work how do you do algebra and rings and modules carry a topology i think this stuff is great and this is where i'm at it's like hey we need to like rev up mathematics you need to upgrade to some physics stuff and i think um we can all learn from it so if you can turn functional analysis into a branch of commutative algebra that's very nice build a version of algebraic geometry allows rings of convergent power series as basic building blocks because my question is how do you actually do analysis in non-archimedean geometry right that's actually kind of tricky and exciting for a mathematician right so you want to put some kind of completeness condition on modules you know which are like they mimic vector spaces but uh the scalars are not fields they can come from the rings the coefficients of the rings and so in such a way that the free objects behave like some kind of power series instead okay so you can construct algebraic geometry you can start with an abelian category of abelian groups you have a tensor product which is just a way of organizing and then you can consider rings in this sort of category you can associate spec r with the same spa r that i showed you in the diamond and basics and open subsets can correspond to localization so look how cool this is you're using localizations to define what an open subset is you include these spec r's together along these open subsets you can form these schemes and accordingly the category of our modules glues to form the category quasi coherence sheets so again this is all uh peter's construction i think it's great how do you construct analytic geometry we'll do the same thing um but topological abelian groups don't form an abelian category i'll just go over this you can use the his notion of condensed mathematics to make it make things a little better you can replace topological groups with these condensed sets so here's the whole point so um this definition right the protel site of a point is the category of pro finite sets so these are cantor sets ish uh with finite jointly subjective families of maps as covers so we say a condensed set is a sheaf of sets on the pro-ital site so again we're working pro-finite and pro-atel because of the diamond condition so similarly a condensed group group um ring whatever um on the protel site is called that you can put a category together condense of condensed objects so this means that this whole thing is a functor so you can get a functor from certain categories and that's fine i don't want to go into this too too much so given a condensed set you can refer to t star as its underlining set so there's a canonical example that illustrates um how you would actually change to um from a topological space so let t be a topological space to t there's associated a condensed set t bar and that's defined by sending any profinite set to the set of continuous maps from s to t this satisfies both properties um it means that for any map for which the composite is continuous it's continuous so t underlined is a condensed um uh this pro finite set um yeah so why like why are we using all this pro finite condition well because once again it's in the language i don't want to get lost in the details so it's in the language right it's in the awareness the level of awareness that you are right dictates your whole complexity class so if and again if these spaces are pro finite spaces right then you need to make sure that uh what do we mean when we say localize we need to make sure we know what the open subsets are and that's why i was using like the pro-itel site there's you know that's just one idea there's lots of ideas how you could model this but the main takeaway that i want you know to kind of leave everybody with is like okay so what are memories like there is no synchronous reference how are we actually getting through time yeah if every point is discretized you must be getting through time uh you know through your localization but i'm trying to try to upgrade the consciousness level and go well you know i think you can actually upgrade the level of awareness if you can start thinking in terms of morphisms and uh morphisms between morphisms so um you get the emergent time phenomena by using the pro-ital site and then you get the diamond holographic principle by using the six operations and the profinitely many copies like that so uh once again you get the chromatic types from looking at these towers of localization and you can put this over a temporal logic to maybe to maybe you know figure out what's going on with clive wearing once again like where is the meaning in that um yeah okay so i put up some of my references and i think i will just stop there awesome thank you so much maybe you can unshare and then we'll be really happy to ask you some questions here to learn more all right sarah maybe take it away yeah so so that was a great brain scramble um like i guess i'm wondering actually this really comes directly from philosophy before i went on this um live stream i was looking at just where topology fits into philosophy by way of this standard insight or stanford encyclopedia and um one thing that stood out to me was was modal logic um and i found myself asking you know with all of these new um topologies or set theory or however you want to do it like we always kind of run into this tension between these really complicated homeomorphic whatever kind of morphic you know our ability to conceptualize these morphisms and our ability to like make use of them like or you know and we make these really complicated math constructs and then but at some point we have to communicate with each other and so i'm kind of wondering with any math construct and like maybe even specifically yours like how do you see the construct converging like looping back you know conceptually such that it doesn't just run away from you know from us in our ability to understand yeah so well that's why i said so for me uh thinking like those constructs are not difficult i would say the communicating part is the difficult part you know like i mean but you should watch children they're all over the place right i think i think you're here to imagine and that you actually i'm like a super synesthete so for somebody like me right i just rattled that off and you saw that that was probably the easiest thing for me but asking me to maybe replace like a cartridge in an ink like a printer that might be really difficult for me so it's interesting that when you say um how do we not lose it so i think and that's what i was saying i think it depends on where your brain thrives like somebody like me i love the font of like oh yeah i'm definitely a three awareness i want to think about morphisms between morphisms and morphisms and so i actually don't think they're difficult i think you you know it's something like it's just a it's just a math is just another language you know and if you're a person that like likes learning new languages i think there is no difficulty around it and so i don't think i for me i don't think there's anything hindering it because i think what's worse is to leave it in a word statement if you didn't have that math justifying it you would just have a sentence saying uh what like the world is unknowable or something like that right so i actually think you're just kind of displacing displacing you know you're doing physics physics is totally hard right you know like okay but let's say for example because in moto logic they were just talking about knowing versus assuming versus you know so they had these kind of conjunctive sections in a sentence and it's i mean i i don't know i think language is actually the hard thing and actually making math hook into language in such a way that we can actually communicate without exhausting each other you know like actually make the make the information transfer um is not you know once you go from like believing to assuming you get all these funky like um you know predicates or you get all these funky like um contingencies and so actually having math such you know that that works with all of these subtleties is like i don't know anyway that's that's where i'm coming from is like how do you get a math that doesn't that doesn't get like pumped by language that's funny yeah but isn't it exciting because you didn't know much about topology until i said it right but you're on an exploration and you're learning more so i don't think it's actually detracting at all right like no no i'm not necessarily detracting i'm saying um facilitate help like compressing compressing language you know compressing concepts right and i think on my end i'm not i i think that's might be deleterious i think it might be open them open all the concepts what's uh you know i don't think time exists anyway so it's like what what's the rush right i'm just fine all right so you know what i mean and one note on that is um the linear strings spoken or podcast or live stream or text right they're often ill-specified but also it it enforces a so-called temporal structure a local syntactic in a semantic structure and um whether one chooses to see these these um associations as foundational like the roots that this is growing out of like the previous literature threads is it running off away into the dark forest of the literature or is it actually anchoring in vast bodies of knowledge so really interesting this discussion oh yeah see that's a dance talk so how cool that uh what's natural for me is like math and literary right so you've got some heavy philosophers that were onto some great things and i'm like hey why don't we just fortify what they're saying with uh some diagrams and you see it's easy if i say oh maybe clive waring's chromatic tower is cut that in a certain way like the math part there is actually while there is a steep learning curve you're able to actually get inside of clive wearing in a way that you're not in a way that just like daniel's saying um you know retrograde amnesia okay great that's a linear word you need a sentence you actually need to go into that what is that and so i actually think language is um deceiving if it's actually too compressed and if it's actually not transparent there's a beautiful transparency in mathematics it's all there you know and again math is not perfect either right there's what is a point we have some serious problems you know you've got you've got predicative and then you know how many definitions in math or self-referencing is horrible you know so like math is not to be worshipped at all and that's why it's like oh we should just have all the languages you can see i talk about everything at once and i'm like but that's my synesthete right i think there's actually the the beautiful thing about the synesthete is that maybe you can see uh like an aerial view of things and i think for me i can do a local global just because of the way my brain works you know but then i was you know i was trying because i love everybody's like differences and i don't want anybody to be like anybody else and i was trying to say like hmm it seems that you know maybe sometimes we're one awarenesses and sometimes we're 12 awarenesses but i really i'm really interested in why um like i don't know how you two are but if like if you have total recall like or memories like have you ever had memories just come in or future memories or deja vu i'm really interested in stuff like that yeah i just wanted to clarify the the compression thing though i want to defend compression for a minute normally i would agree you know like the the connotation with that i'm like no that's bad you throw away a lot of nice subtleties but i've definitely felt um in my limited experience with philosophy i've definitely bumped up against um some spots where there have been words that if you know somebody once somebody hits it when somebody puts a noun to a concept to a word it's like this fantastic compression algorithm where it's like oh that's a concept somebody had and they put it into a word and now i can pack it up and like make some more space in my brain for other stuff and i think that is like bad practice whether it can be in math or or in words like in whatever mean means you do it's it's just it's the best so i'm always now i'm finding myself like looking for that for that ratchet you know and you would love well then you would love math but it's like then because it's all symbols right but i'm just saying yeah i guess i don't see it compressing it doesn't have this at least not for my brain like i can't i can't like it doesn't package something up so i can make more space for other things but it but it does because it's like oh there's a tower so you can just keep the tower in your brain and not the 800 pages that got there just like when somebody puts a noun on a concept like anti-sitter space um i think yeah i mean for me it would be i would be deceiving myself to think i'm just storing the word you're not you're storing all the physics and everything in them you know what do you what do you think about that um right you know this nesting is a topic that comes up a lot so we talk about nested markov decision processes how within the active inference model just only looking at the mathematics within this one little clade of math you can nest those models but then there's also nesting that's based upon category theory not my area but it seems like there's very nuanced ways of doing nesting and relationships and so what i heard with this discussion around like a sort of a whole total system shift upgrade with a dictionary it's like synergetics and bucky fuller in that if you understand the interfaces interfaces between what these things are currently doing in the system you can take them out and like hot swap them it's like okay it's a graphics card we could make it a different graphics card or we could have the same interface and then improve what's on the other side of the interface and then it turns out to be really meta because we're working on active inference which is in a way the theory about how the interfaces work and definitely in the active inference lab we're taking a different um approach but it's like mount everest because we're you know meeting at different base camps together to talk with people who have different perspectives yeah yeah which is but that's where everything thrives is in the intersections right so that's yeah it's like look how much stronger math is when you hit it with philosophy also vice versa or any of this stuff or any of the bio right upgrade retrograde amnesia to a chromatic tower and it's like whoa you know so i think i think nothing is lost in the intersection then what did you say earlier about uh what bucky called emergence you said something cool uh emergence through emergency yeah yeah and his emergency like the uh every time i like survival or like what to actually connect that's what you said about your uh string of natural language being effortless in active inference we think about how the action is following in some sense actually on a geodesic a path of least resistance like the chemical reaction even if it releases a lot of heat and light in the context that it's in it actually is the most probable thing or the most energy releasing thing the free energy is negative and so it dissipates and um understanding how that dissipation can be brought into the informational regime with semantic flow and like a delta g for for semantic information rather than just syntax or even chemistry that's about this mapping of mappings with free energy as a nomadic concept in a way or a nexus that we connect the free energy in the chemical we develop certain experiments maybe unique predictions and then by building the math that's general enough to interface nicely we actually we nest the concepts so that we can deal with the nested systems that are more syntactic at the lower level going down into the quantum and then more semantic at the higher level into the teleological good yeah and then the semantic at the higher level right then you can invoke a homotopic type chromatic type and then you can actually you know uh all the types are nomatic as well so i like that right nothing is until it actually like spreads so i also think you know it's it's a false conception of movement if you actually think you know if you don't start from the middle and spread you know hey shayna can we um i wonder if we can anchor some some some exploration around uh one of your questions it's on the list yeah um so like but i don't remember what they are and it might be too much of a technical hassle to post them so if you could like pick one of the questions that you're bringing up yeah let me just share again and then you tell me which one you like okay okay this will be like the uh who wants to be a millionaire of right this is cool yeah who wants to be the millionaire back to the principle should we should we do a quick random number generator no pick one yeah just look at a few and then let's anchor them and then go wild whatever one okay so so actually now this helps trip my memory so and then don't forget i have these two so pick which one maybe i can like make it can you see that yeah i can't um this is something i've been tripping out on a bit so and see so measurement 2-2 yeah no i know where it is um i thought i might pick a second one but um that's definitely should i go with that and then you bring it down or do you want it let's go let me unshallow i can see y'all's lovely places okay we're saying what is it what is measurement right yeah go for it yeah yeah well um i i tend to take a lot of these i i'm finding that i have a attraction to taking a lot of these questions and putting them in some embodied form that seems to be i don't know how i'm going to do that in a thesis in such a way that i actually graduate but um this is it's really interesting to me i i um you know we have affordances we have tools and all these other things these kind of prosthetics that allow us to make sense of the world but i i really just think of them as prosthetics and in a sense we're we're um making sense of the world by feeling and and i mean feeling in the the one sense of like feeling you know whether or not that actually relates to emotions that's another really interesting question but um to be conservative you know i'm just talking about feeling like our tactile sense and then we use all these affordances to augment our tactical sense but so it's really interesting to think about like all this objective measurement in science and whatnot and how that's actually related to to our embodied like it won't be true to us at some level unless we can makes out of it to make sense out of it at an embodied level so that's is that that's as there was another kind of hook i had in philosophy but um i can't really remember what it is right now but that's something that's alive for me so i don't know if you have any thoughts about it yeah well i'm like super impact too right so uh to you know i i'm going to dissociate the emotional from the irrational like i don't believe in that and uh they both are equally there right the rationality is like the emotional uh guidance system so yeah when i say like when i say what is a measurement i'm just saying there's a lot that goes into that that says you know this is the fixed speed of light and this is the this and so measurement seems like it only holds up to a certain condition right this is the this is the speed of light until i change your ambient space right if you lived on a taurus or if you lived on a klein bottle if you lived on something else i promise you you'd have a different speed of light because that's just the illumination problem in mathematics given a strange space right and i put a point source in it what uh if you trace out all the rays right well every point in the actual shape be hit not really it won't if you have a very complicated space so for uh for me how far how far does the measurement hold and metrics again since i'm such a fan of like topology and sheaves and things like this the metric seems like it is uh not substantial right it is it is based on like i said inter-subjective agreement among agents so when you say um you know like i i yeah i'm not sure if your question is like is it objective or subjective i think all measurements here are subjective right uh and so also here's an actual problem in the measurement if you're like strict copenhagenist and stuff like that right so um nothing should quote exist right if everything is in its free form of superposition what does it actually mean to measure something without like actually limiting the thing and who's the measurement for if you crush the superposition into like one state i've measured it right i don't know what that means and i also think that the minute all your observers go away the the thing that was measured goes back into its original state so that's why i said like what is a measurement and chris and i are always talking about this right that that assumes that you are somehow independent of the thing that you're measuring and i don't know how to actually do that right i don't really know what a boundary is because if you zoom into your arm we could take like an electron transmission microscope and i'd be able to zoom into your arm in like two seconds so where'd the boundary go you know where is the boundary and that i i'm i'm very perplexed because the boundary in mathematics is like some kind of asymptote right what is an acid like you know so are you dealing with sort of uh asymptotes and that's that's what we're calling a measurement you know you're like a bus is this long true until i subject the bus to a lot of time or i pour gasoline on the bus and burn it you know what i mean so how long does the measurement hold you know yeah i like that so so you're yeah so i i hadn't thought about so much about context and feeling i was definitely like it's a fixed thing so that's that's useful to think about not really like fixed according to whom fixed for that second but like yeah everything is in free fall and like you see um i really think there is nothing periodic here i think there is no repetition right we have to actually account for like what leap year or something right because the calendar is off so i'm i'm really uh i'm really impressed that in our like in everybody's free fall and you know what the earth is going a thousand miles an hour east right and that if everything is rotating your own cells are popping in and out where is the measurement i'm not sure nothing is fixed so it's very silly to think that i have this measurement it's like if you only knew that you were actually working over discrete time in that moment the moment that you were measuring the bus is no longer there right so that's what i'm very very interested in i measured the bus five minutes ago but is it the same bus no and i don't know what that means so that's what like what are you actually measuring we could measure profanity many copies of the thing but you need to say that the measurement is of the reflection of the thing and that's that's the one thing i do like about the temporal parts work is that the bus yesterday is it really the bus today i don't know and i've always been i've always been perplexed that you know you wake up to the same space but do you really i'm not really sure and so um that's you know uh boundaries i'm really interested in boundaries and like how they actually uh how they work because i'm not really sure they do i mean clearly like i can hit my hand on a on the on the glass but that's just that's at this scale right if i so i'm just saying that a measurement if you're going to say a measurement then you need to be real precise about uh there's no time involved there's no this involved it's only at an instant boom this measurement holds at an instant because tomorrow who knows and what's up with the measuring stick like there's so many uh like quantum mechanically the meteor stick doesn't exist anyway so so i don't even know how to use all these freaking philosophical labels but i want to ask if your ambition in in trying to apply uh topology a kind of a paradigm is to arrive at some form of realism or are you interested in i mean i'm kind of wondering what your ground is in terms of like yeah what would be the what's the end goal in terms of like what would be the perfect math in your mind like where would it take you right yeah well i'm after those grain unified theories right so i'm after the i'm after the unifying the grand unified theories of physics with the grain unified theories of math because i actually think the math one encompasses the physics that's why you see me going hey why don't we look at like a number theoretic version of a black hole something like that because i think that in the grand unified theories of math i'm gonna get everything because i'm a super tech mark like uh level four but you're gonna you're gonna get everything you're gonna get you're gonna ever what are you gonna get oh yeah well that's why i said like oh well are you calling reality like just this little glip you got to remember that i believe in like in consciousness right so my goal is to actually partition the brain partition the consciousness so that you can actually experience everything at once again i don't believe in linear time i don't think it goes linearly and i'm really baffled why the brain only does that and i think it does not because i know when you're freshly formed like um a baby it's very it's such a beautiful being because you know she's like a little portal i'm like where did you come from you know like the very act of birth is something interesting because it seems like it's something that got through the interface right where did this little portal come from and i'm actually i'm not so interested in the mechanics of the interface i'm interested in breaking through the interface taking off the interface and trying another one because again i think that the 20 fundamental numbers and everything that you're subjected to here and the laws of physics or whatever are just purely interface-based which i which i think is a mathematics concept it would be so rad if we were all able to take off the interface of this complexity of our current complexity and quote go somewhere else i don't mean milky way i don't mean that i mean leave this interface all together of three times of three space and one time and go find a different modulized space right and that's what i'm trying to do with i'm like oh if you could actually partition consciousness right because it seems like i don't know if y'all had like general anesthesias or like if you've ever fainted or anything um i have a like a few times just from like kind of intense things but i remember something remained it's like you might have wiped out the consciousness by general anesthesia right but you didn't take away the awareness and that's what i was very curious about that something was still there and so uh you know don hoffman and like me it's like i'm actually interested in what that space is right the kind of talky sensory thing like i can see that as an apparatus but i'm sorry i'm interested in like the divinity whatever the infinity not in a religious sense but like what actually transcends this because i don't think anything here is like real at all you know so when people say what's your baseline reality well it's not this i'm really always curious to get in the dream space i'm really always curious to quote sleep because when i'm asleep who's asleep oh your body is not a sleeve right because you would you know die so i'm really curious in the states that are actually i guess i could say it like this i'm trying to take subjectivity out of the interface and put it in a different setting i'm not going to have subjectivity limited by just what the body can do because there's a lot of pain a lot of pain keeps people in the body when i think you could actually be like someone else you know so if you could take subjectivity on its own exploration which is what i think mathematics is really good about doing like if i can have you know uh people like oh let's think about simultaneous like what if you know what if we were actually here and also you know at a cambridge apostle meeting that baffles people because you know you have this imagination right we're able to talk and you're you know i can say oh sarah david let's imagine like we're in hawaii swimming with the you know the sea turtles you can go there just like that what is that why can you do that what is that imaginary space so i actually think we're actually really gifted creatures and you have this beautiful tool called the imagination which has not been fortified so what i'm trying to do is actually put the imagination in its own little hogwarts school right like when you're young you're able to do plays and you're doing all those things then you go up and it's like taxes and like that and it's like no i actually think we're here to be creative and you can see all the philosophers that i like are vitalists right and so i think being is creation so you can see that i'm here to i think we're here to create new theories and to break through the interface now that i'm not saying people go jump in front of buses that's not what i'm saying right i'm saying it'd be cool to peek through it just sort of like how a new baby arrives i am perplexed at birth nobody can explain it and you have no idea like how something broke through um yeah the interface so where i'm after with that you see i'm using uh very beautiful mathematics i think i think life is very sacred and very beautiful and it should be um supported and and uh explained by an equally sophisticated mathematical structure so i don't really abide by this the simplest version is the best i don't know about that i actually think that what is what is sophisticated philosophically should be equally matched in sophistication mathematically and then you get a synergy and a harmony and actually then you can actually explain a grain unified theory because i really think uh i you know if everything is a diamond which i really think it is you know there's a lot of i think if this reality is like a modular space of diamonds then i can just easily jump to a new modulized space it's not that difficult you know i don't know if that sounds like you're like who's this little per oh yeah i'm i'm totally like an explorer i'd be like let's jump in the consciousness bus and go look at stuff because it's not just this it's not just what is i'm you know your awareness never leaves and it's awesome to kind of enter that space you know and actually like bring it here you know if you can actually bring the consciousness space to here then you're actually more synesthetic i think you know uh yeah because i i don't know where one skill ends and the brain seems to be you know a hologram itself so when everything when your central processor is a hologram it makes me really curious about what this space is you know i definitely don't think the brain is like this you know of course you don't want to get hit in the head obviously but it's freaky ability to rewrite right it's like a super hamming codes you've got like air correcting code in the brain obviously to keep the organism alive you know but um i i think you know to come up with like a you know you know like the riemann zeta function as a black hole like that's cool so i'm just kind of trying to upgrade uh you know find what is the essence of things and it's like oh is it math what is this you know ah the essence i'll ask one question which is how how would you imagine that this insight or this set of upgrades potentially being taught to advanced or younger students could change research or practice because i noticed words like descent condition definability decidability completeness of course so where do the sort of everyday usages of these terms come into play with how we can rethink them based upon a new level of mathematical rigor oh that's such a great question yeah i'm such an advocate for like new models of pedagogy right because i think the way mathematics is taught now is horrible and it makes you know everyone uh frightened it's like you're taught calculus first before logic before topology before any of it right and so it seems like you know you there people are not using the apostle book that should be the only book used for calculus um yeah so if you actually if you taught a category theory straight you know from the bottom up imagine the beautiful connections that would be able to be made cross-disciplinary you can see that one of my main goals is to get people to talk with each other get the mathematicians to talk with the physicists to talk with the philosophers um you know i think through category theory you would naturally embody this synesthetic thinking which is what i'm trying to be an advocate for because there's people like non-linear thinkers like me that can be easily shunned and didn't say well she works at the intersection she's not you know serious about the one topic and i'm like but the one topic is a reflection of the other topics when everything is a diamond so for me i i see that if you were introducing these beautiful words like ah descent condition and like if you start from category theory which is so minimally constructed and only and and allows you to add what you need to build your own space right you are you are able to build um um i i would say you're able to to build in accordance with your own idea versus taking another idea and chiseling it away and adding things artificially the nice thing about category theory is that these limits everything is built into the actual uh theory itself i'm not starting with something and adding and then adding and then adding and then taking away and being like what is it analysis or is it like this so you see there's there's all these ways and like you know petershaw's like reconstructing you know uh functional analysis as commutative algebra that super sent a seat because what you're doing is like taking what you thought was a difference and you're actually making it the same thing so i'm such an advocate for inclusivity and welcoming so many trains of thought and if everyone was like oh hey though that looks like just a morphism of this and this looks like a morphism of this it would actually aid research because everybody would be working together you know like can you imagine like new antidotes and um you know i'm like a mental health advocate and uh because um you know there's been a lot of stuff like i don't know i'm sure everyone has had you know elderly family members go through some you know horrible neurodegeneration and i am not satisfied with the way that the brain is being modeled and i'm like you know if you actually were using the morphisms or the chromatic tower idea maybe you would be able to understand what's actually going on in somebody you know um and we'd be able to relate to them empathically instead of just like this like clear-cut medicinal thing well they'll never be good again they lost their memory well we can you know no i don't think it's something that can be lost let's just try to reconstruct the morphisms you know so there's like there's so many things that i'm after with this one is unifying all these branches that are working against each other it's like when the mathematicians and the physicists honestly work together right if if they can and not have a bunch of egos in the way then the beauty that results you get these beautiful grand unified theories because it's like we're meant to be inclusive and everybody to help each other and so everybody knows that like i'm you know not an advocate for these like standardized tests and i'm gonna test you and i'm better than you and like i don't know why we test people to be better than everybody we could actually be working on things like this so i think it like uh it would completely revolutionize pedagogy and it would offer a future model of like what a what a hogwarts school could look like because then you're actually like okay hey we have the imagination as a gift it is a gift that you have this and so through what i'm trying what i'm doing here it's like a very creative take at learning mathematics and things like that so then you've actually welcomed into mathematics those underrepresented who identify as creatives you know i also teach at this art school and you know they're always like well i don't have the the best math gifts and i'm like but look at your visual skills and in a certain sense they they're almost the same you know so i think there's a lot of beauty like it's like diamonds and things like this were taught you know very early or even to all like a lot of people that you know if you could integrate this into the research then you would um i just think there's beauty and everyone working together i'm not a very competitive person you know reminded me of how could you imagine a way that uh that art could actually inform math rather than the reverse like not not just art but like improv improvisation improvisational arts upon somebody's drawing just free form and if you could figure out a dynamic mapping of like oh you're actually talking about this this kind of logic and you don't and you're drawing it but you're not you're not putting it to you know you don't even know that you mean that but you mean that that is actually kind of fascinating look how beautiful that is yeah i just got accepted to what you just said is um you know i'm an advocate for pedagogy in the creative settings so i'll do i'll do uh you know experiments like that all the time like their their topic is to design a four-dimensional university like i want a four-dimensional university i want a gymnasium featuring flying lessons right and i want a library and um i want you to talk about adinkras or dinkers or james gates air correcting codes these students right have minimal mathematics skills but they are in their learning analysis geometry and topology to actually make a structure that can hold flying lessons they're actually having to teach themselves a four dimensional coordinate grid that's not euclidean this is not euclidean at all it's differential geometry right it's bumpy and i said you know because it's four dimensional and they only have hyper volumes so how amazing that you know it's sort of like um you know for me it's very sad that it's only super exclusive like you know like the exeter academy that has this harkness method so what i do is i take the hardness method and i i speak it everywhere right i teach it at cal state i teach it here and all over the place and um that method of showing of giving a concept uh synergetically like that and showing you know just giving minimal instruction they're learning math themselves and so uh it's like you know i so i'm interested in other people who want to experiment like that you don't learn the chapter one this is a triangle you know nobody learns like that because the way that you actually learn uh is to integrate so you know why do students have so much problem so many problems solving word problems because they've been taught these subjects separately these subjects are not separate at all they should be taught integrated in a holistic manner and you're totally right sarah the way to get holistic manner like um easily digestible is in a creative way i showed my students like a um this awesome computer programmer solving a 4d rubik's cube i said recreate that and they actually had oh the four dimension does this oh it's a test oh it has that many sides so much easier than a very linear lesson this is a four space with uh that you know i think i think um uh you know if you're an intuit like me and most math comes from this intuition space you need to honor that intuition space and i i really think it's shunned so there's mathematicians like ramanujan and stuff like that who is saying i don't know where this idea came from it just came from this and you know that can be really shunted and so but i think a lot of this visionary stuff you know comes from um like a non-specific space and oh my god i will nurture people's creative space look how many ideas come out when you do some kind of like fun icebreaker like that right so anytime i host a conference or something you know i you know i'm like uh well you know imagine we were you know uh you know alligators you know so i have people change the space if you change oh you know you had claws what would you do with these claws you know and so it's like if you can kind of shake up you know uh the reel and turn it into something um kind of imaginary i think the imagination is more real so for somebody like me i privy the imaginary space because like this pin i think there was an idea of a pin before the pin so the pin is okay in my opinion but i still think the imaginary space trumps everything right you had to have the idea of the car i want to have the idea of the thing so i put a lot of my efforts into nurturing like students imaginary space you know so oh my god yeah infusing like having uh you can teach math in a creative way and that's why i'm so excited that there are these people like me you know i write books and it's like oh it's like i'm going to write i'm going to write you know um i'm going to write a girl and a diamond i like my opening line this is like my new book is like she slept in an hourglass why not right so that's what you're doing anyway and it's like oh wait through glass what is that so i can actually give you a shape i can introduce the shape to you creatively and then i can actually tell you theorems about the shape but i didn't start with the theorems right i started with this rough intuitive idea that actually had a texture to it so people go what is it like to sleep in an hourglass god does do i get eaten by the sand am i the sand does somebody turn me over what happens when the time runs out you know and so uh through people's own introspection i get some really solid thinkers and that's what i'm after i'm not after people wrote memorizing and like wrote test tests of course are difficult right but it's how many people remember the material after it you know what i mean like so memorizing through rote is not what i'm into i'm into actually building the inner space the inner space of independent learners who can think and who can cross-reference because again i will i'll just always say that your strongest thinkers are thinkers who can think along all of those intersections right you know if there's a problem like the rover crashes yeah you need your cs people but you also need your physics people you need your math people and that's why you know uh normally those research groups have that i don't know and daniel you may have that too right in your labs i bet you have people from all disciplinaries working on the inference stuff right species of every type of insect um well our approach with active inference lab is provide the affordance and the opportunity to co-design and wherever people are at in learning about active inference or curious about related topics or wanting to apply it in some domain we just sort of meet in the middle and work to use active inference as a unifying topic and a bridge because it um and that's really that's why you're here because we actually got to intersect with active inference coming to me all these other ideas and what you said about the book reminded me of bucky fuller's tetris scroll which is about the goldilocks and the three bears but the four of them are a tetrahedron and so it talks about how the tetrahedra is the minimal system and there's all these tetrahedral jokes that are embedded and so it's like learning by doing and through stories and through characters and by drama so all these creative dimensions that allow us to actually be generative within so-called alternate but today's alternate fashion is tomorrow's you know out of date and then retro it just it's historical so how do we respect rigor as well as this very radically intersubjective like you're talking about with agents with different perspectives but then also we need local logics that aren't just totally discordant because then when we're talking about the systems that sustain us um we need those to also persist so how do we how do we that was my question is how do we unify the rigor and the sort of almost transcendent or at least if not universal something like that with intersubjective definitions on the mortal plane right and you can actually see right in my talk i didn't give you some kind of loose map very particular right so i think i'm actually rather gifted in that regard probably why i got hired so quick with all this stuff is that i'm able to introduce an idea in a creative way but i give you absolute rigor so that you know it through and through right but i give you enough rigor to know that object but i also endow you with the creativity to be able to intersect it somewhere else else so we all say the mortal plane right but you won't really be aware when you pass away and you already could have you can't prove that you exist anyway right so i'm like yes respect your life force yeah but don't ever think that you're not infinite because there's no proof that you aren't right so like there's this structure like there is no structural causality you know you go somewhere but you will never be aware of it and i all i always say uh when people ask me that how do we how do we take your your lovely um you know your lovely uh um you know kind of goodies from the higher planes and like work with them here and i'm like well the higher planes are here you're in them right it's not like it's outside of you you know like you're born from the very universe it's all in you and it's sort of like i remember when i was trying to say like would you actually be aware when you pass so what you won't right and that's that's strange that's very strange so it seems to be this like impasse limiting thing all the more to value your imaginary space like i know when i'm trying to go to sleep and i'm like uh i'm like i'm gonna i'm gonna actually be aware when i actually go to sleep you're not right when you go to sleep you just you wake up right you're never actually like aware of the moment you go to sleep right and i'm like oh that's very strange what is this awareness phenomena right so yeah there is the uh i and so when people call it mortal plane i guess i call it the interface that's one possible interface but again babies can breach through it and i also think there's other ways of getting other interfaces yeah so how you balance the rigor is that well i'm giving you some of the top mathematics like on the planet yeah so that rigor you have to be yeah for your own integrity and as a pedagogue and an intellectual of course you are you're here to make the planet better for everyone so you already you have an in integrity to uh do honor to your subject so to do honor to your subject you learn it perfectly yeah but you can also know that there's stories around it you learn the rigor but you can also how you learn the rigor could be creatively and it doesn't have to be through a very rote memorization right a category as an object with if you learn it in a very beautiful way then i'm also going to honor that so that's what i mean by like a creative setting i don't ever go oh yeah here's this like diamond thing and that's it no it's actually very specific but it's according to who i'm talking to if it's like super you know um uh you know mathematicians are already this level then i just start with that right if i'm introducing it to undergrads right i will start with an intuitive um an intuitive uh kind of um i don't know derivative of the thing and then actually introduce them into that because i want them to retain it i don't want them to shut down i don't want to invoke their cortisol system right so i'm really i'm an advocate for like metacognitive techniques so once i um i i'm getting a really good feel about how people learn and so the minute you know how you think somebody like me super abstract throw me the intersection of something and i'll get it right the way that you balance rigor and creativity is to know who the actual learner is yeah so who they are and it's almost like i guess i would say my pedagogy is like a harp and i'm tuning a harp because i myself am a harp so the way that you're going to actually balance the rigor and the creativity is for your own self to be harp like so that i can tune to the actual student oh they're more of a creative i'll try it like this oh they're more of an engineer well i'll i'll try an engineering i'll try a system way right i i just uh you know explain diamonds to like a bunch of computer science people and i turned it into data structures so if i can align it with something that they already know for me i think that learning is about having constellations in your head how many constellations do you have um can you actually link everything together and so if i'm if there's too much like quote rigor without uh you know without a creative setting i think i i have i will fail the people that don't have the constellations yet bunch of experts i could do that as well but um you know i also nobody knows nobody knows the consciousness realm nobody knows what this actually is and at least i'm open to saying that every theorem i come up with it's just a theorem some people think they're absolutely right and i really don't agree with that like at all we have rough ideas of what it means to do this and this but that's why i'm asking like what actually are the fundamental units of life you know you can tell me when the interface breaks but you can't tell me about awareness and like if i asked a neuroscience like why can i not split the consciousness right they would say well you know i don't know you know because i'm not talking about like i'm not talking about partitioning the brain and you just have like two it's like like you would see like a split screen like those old movies i'm not talking about that right i'm actually talking about double experience double experience triple experience but not just sensory you know so i think i think the way that you balance the rigor with the creativity is to also have integrity with yourself integrity to the subject um anyone who actually wants to learn it i wants to learn the specificities right but what's what if you don't have creativity you'll never be able to go anywhere with the rigor i give you if you're just rigorous you're just going to be there but if i can instill in you creativity and you're actually going to be able to take the rigor and link it and intersect it and again if so it's all about like why you think you know your phenomenological like state i think we're here to create new things i think being is creation so if i can give you rigor but it can also hold your imaginary space then you'll be able to take that idea like nobody else but me would take diamonds and apply them to consciousness you know what i mean right so we're getting close to close to the end of the hour but maybe um i'm kind of curious about about what um what started you in math like like how old you were oh totally young well i was like hmm you know i i uh i was like what is this thing you know what i mean i would stare at mirrors and i'm like that's really interesting and then um i was basically asking my parents like why am i not falling through the floor you know because i i got pretty early on that all this stuff sort of looked like it was made out of the same thing and i'm like why are you like why am i not falling through the floor like what is holding all this together he's also very very curious as to why i woke up in the same thing i was like why am i not a lobster tomorrow so there was some kind of stability here that i was very perplexed by i'm also an avid reader and when you read there's like a voice in your head reading and i was like who's that who is that when people are talking to themselves who is that you know i was also highly aware that when you're sleeping who was asleep nobody was asleep if i was up remembering dreams and things like this so it was very vivid you know i would have lots of connections with like animals and um you know not like body swap but it was super super empathic um and i would visit you know uh kind of divine places and be like oh this is exciting and so what i found is that um you know avid readers already had the literary space but i was like what are these i always thought that there was something else and so what i love about math right is that it was it was um this beautiful language and a gift that allowed me to actually think about uh higher worlds you know in a you know in a structured way and so i was like oh wow this is an actual language and i thought that there was something universal about it right but there's not a lot of dialects for math you know and it made it really simple like oh you know category theory hey i do too versus like i was teaching myself mandarin and mine i you know i still have this california kind of accent thing right it didn't work so well and so the dialects can actually hurt language but uh math seemed to be this like universal way and i was like oh hey maybe we can all you know figure out what this thing is again math is not it's like my version of math you can see is very philosophical right so it's like um also my favorite writer was like you know alice in wonderland and i'm like oh through the looking glass like that's cool and at the end he's doing all the syllogisms and i thought hey if you take like you know awesome like oh syllogisms i can just mess around with that and i've just messed with causality you know paradox and things like that so super avid reader getting my hands on big philosophy very young and also staying open to like to what is because i could tell that time wasn't linear and i was like i need a subject but i can actually figure all this out like time it's not linear like how can i do that and then i oh topology and spectral spaces and stuff like oh it looks like that yeah i would say it made my synthesis like comfortable you know what i mean yeah yeah cool well i'm uh i don't think i have anything else and we're getting kurds in so what do you think i uh would be remiss not to ask how you thought active inference plays into this or what you thought about active inference yeah without the end like that's what you're saying right how the interfaces actually intersect or just right what what comes to mind when you think about active inference and cybernetics and control theory and where some of this like agent in the niche goes from there's the analytical there's the philosophical and then not getting into the the theology of what's real but just like there's the agents the model about how the agent is operating in the niche so where does what does active inference make yeah well i guess um from like uh you know the way that you've defined it so again i'm interested into okay so here's like uh i guess my my knowledge of it right so here's an agent with uh i mean i guess right with a certain interface i quote interact with you like whatever that means and so in my opinion the way that things are interacting is through how many morphisms they actually generate so it's actually categorical so i don't do this sort of like analytical thing like philosoph philosophical because again i i'm from this higher space so if you just if you look at active inference maybe through category theory now what's really happening it's like oh oh interesting at what at what instant does my interaction with this like opposite agent or whatever throw me into a reflective subcategory where i'm actually just interacting with myself so i'm really interested in where uh the interface theory can actually uh meet topological localization like i was talking about so i think uh what see what i like about this is that it sounds like you're doing the same thing that i'm doing with which different language so a topological localization right i'm interested in how do you find the inverses and relate more and make my space stronger um you know by passing through these reflective subcategories and so if it's like oh if the active inference is how these agents are swapping and actually interacting because that's very curious it's very curious how what i'm taking your information into like my data structure and i don't know like what receiving looks like on that end so i would just say that categorically it sounds like we're doing the same thing and then it gets pretty meta for me when i'm sort of like uh i take your info and then it becomes part of my system and it's part of my own reflective subcategory and i like i don't know like keep moving on or something but you know if it's about if it's about how interfaces work um i still don't know how you got the original interface so um i don't know if that means anything you know some of these ideas we talked a little bit about in active inference 17 2.0.1.2 because that was the paper that we focused on for those weeks by fields and glazebrook but i think what you have pointed to today really also gives us a lot of things to go over again and think about so maybe we can um stay in touch and if you ever want to join for another conversation or participate in any other way it'd be awesome because it's really thought provoking and i hope our lab enjoys it yeah so fun thank you so much i had a great time thank you bye
